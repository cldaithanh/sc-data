  "sn13.1:1.1": "Although this chapter does not mention dependent origination, it is thematically linked. It depicts the realization of stream-entry as insight into Dhamma (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.27/en/sujato#5.1'>SN 12.27:5.1</a>), so that future rebirths are minimized (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.41/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 12.41:2.1</a>). The similes are also found in the Linked Discourses on the Truths (SN 56). ",
  "sn13.1:1.3": "The simile is used in the same application at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.51/en/sujato'>SN 56.51</a>; for the rareness of opportune rebirth at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn20.2/en/sujato'>SN 20.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.61/en/sujato'>SN 56.61</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.62/en/sujato'>SN 56.62</a>; and for the absence of even a tiny bit of form that is permanent at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.97/en/sujato'>SN 22.97</a>. ",
  "sn13.1:2.4": "The <i lang='pi' translate='no'>diṭṭhisampanna</i> is the stream-enterer. They are “accomplished in view” because they have directly seen the four noble truths and need no longer rely on faith in another. ",
  "sn13.1:2.6": "For a stream-enterer, countless future lives of suffering have ceased, and only seven rebirths at most remain. ",
  "sn13.1:2.7": "The root sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhisamaya</i> is “gathering”, as a group of brahmins for a congress (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.1.1), or as breaths to a dying man (4.4.1), or as winnings to the victor of the game (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.1.4). In Buddhism, it acquires the technical sense of the “comprehension” of the Dhamma at least at stream-entry. The English word “gather” has a similar meaning: to reach a conclusion by intuitively putting two and two together. "
