  "sn13.11:1.2": "Sineru, also known as Neru (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja379/en/sujato#3.1'>Ja 379:3.1</a>), Meru (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#7.2'>DN 32:7.2</a>), or Sumeru (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thi-ap17/en/sujato#53.2'>Thi Ap 17:53.2</a>), is the <em>axis mundi</em>, the mountain around which the world revolves. The oldest reference is perhaps Taittiriya Āraṇyaka 1.7.1.3. Kaśyapa, the eighth above the seven Sūryas, dwells constantly on Meru, never leaving, while the other Suns illuminate different regions. Sages have gone as far as the regions around, but none reached the mountain itself. "
