  "sn15.3:1.4": "Each world system—or as we would say, solar system—has four oceans (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.80/en/sujato#4.2'>AN 3.80:4.2</a>). These were proverbial for an abundance of wealth (Rig Veda 9.33.6, 10.47.2; Atharva Veda 19.27.3). There are eastern and western oceans (RV 10.136.5, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.6.3.11; eastern sea at ŚB 10.6.4.1, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.1.2), and upper and lower (RV 7.6.7, 10.98.5). We can identify the eastern and western oceans as the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, while the lower is the Indian Ocean, into which water flows from the upper heavenly ocean in the Himalayas. "
