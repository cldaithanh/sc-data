  "sn8.5:2.1": "While this sounds like a standard teaching, it is only found in this context. A different set of five factors is at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.198/en/sujato'>AN 5.198</a>. ",
  "sn8.5:7.1": "The truth is undying because the principles of the Dhamma are always true (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.20/en/sujato#2.3'>SN 12.20:2.3</a>). To put it another way, it is never false to say that conditioned things are impermanent. ",
  "sn8.5:7.2": "“Undying speech” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>amṛtā vāco</i>) is found in Vedic context (eg. Jaimini Gṛhyasūtra 2.1, Brahma Purāṇa 219.58), where it means speech that is immortal since it is of the Divine. ",
  "sn8.5:7.4": "The Sanskrit version of this verse translates as, “Truth may be the undying speech, for true speech is unexcelled. Truth and speech are grounded in the meaning and teaching.” (Uv 8.14). See too Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.2.1.25.4, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amṛte satye pratiṣṭhitām</i>. "
