There are notable differences between the two versions. In several passages, including this one, he reflects on the struggles he faced in his path, showing a high degree of self-awareness and persistence. ",

  "sn8.1:3.1": "There is some confusion regarding the Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ugga</i> (“warrior chief”). Pali commentaries and Sanskrit sources (Manu 10.9) speak of a caste called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ugga</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ugra</i>), born of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khattiya</i> father and a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sudda</i> mother. They were reviled as cruel, and their duty was to catch snakes and other underground vermin (Manu 10.49). This is not the aristocratic warriors referred to here. The distinction is noted in Medhātithi’s commentary to Manu 4.212, who says the Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ugra</i> was a key figure in the king’s alliance, which is supported by the use at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.7.2'>DN 3:2.7.2</a>.
