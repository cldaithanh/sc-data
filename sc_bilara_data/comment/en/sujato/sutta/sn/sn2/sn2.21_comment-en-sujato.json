  "sn2.21:1.3": "This is the only clear appearance of Shiva (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>siva</i>, “auspicious”, “kindly”) in early Pali (but see Sivaka at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn10.8/en/sujato'>SN 10.8</a>). In the Rig Veda he appears a few times under the name Rudra, the “roarer”, where he is feared but approached as dispenser of blessed healing (Rig Veda 2.33). Along with other gods, he is there sometimes described as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śiva</i>, “kindly, blessed”. As time went on his kindly aspect became more prominent, but he never lost his destructive side. He was not normally known as Shiva until the Purāṇic period. | The next few deities have names that are similar in meaning: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khema</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>serī</i>.
