  "sn2.12:1.1": "Veṇhu (variant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>veṇḍu</i>) is the Pali spelling of Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viṣṇu</i>, who in Pali appears only here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#14.1'>DN 20:14.1</a>. He appears somewhat often in the Rig Veda, where he is an ally of Indra in his battle with the constrictor serpent (4.18.11, 6.20.2, 8.100.12). His name is explained as meaning “widespread” due to his role as the wide-stepping solar god who made three great strides over the earth, the midspace, and the heavens, opening up the broad expanse of the world. He also played a role in fertility (Rig Veda 7.36.9, 10.84.1). By the time of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa he was identified with the sacrifice (eg. 1.1.2.13), and was said to be a dwarf, perhaps as the shrunken sun of dusk (1.2.5.5). In one passage he is mystically identified with Indra as Maghavan (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.1.1.13). | Just as the previous chapter featured Indra under several names, the deities in the next few Suttas may also be names of Vishnu, although the identifications are weak.

  "sn2.12:2.1": "The common Pali terms <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manuja</i> (“mankind”, “man”), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manussa</i> (“human”), and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mānava</i> (usually “(Vedic) student”, occasionally “son of man”) all have the same root sense, “child of Manu”. Vishnu himself was a child of Manu via his mother Ākūti, Manu’s daughter. "
