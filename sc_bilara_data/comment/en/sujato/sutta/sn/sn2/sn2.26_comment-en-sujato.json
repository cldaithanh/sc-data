  "sn2.26:1.2": "Rohitassa means “red horse”, Agni in his manifestation as the swift sunbeam. Agni was he of red horses (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rohidaśva</i>, Rig Veda 1.45.2, 4.1.8, 8.43.16, 10.7.4, 10.98.9; see 2.10.2). This can mean the tongues of the ritual fire whose message is speedily conveyed to the gods, but especially the “ruddy steed” swift as the wind (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aruṣā rohitā</i>, 1.94.10), the “red horses of the dawn” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aruṇebhir aśvair</i>, Rig Veda 1.113.14, see 4.52.2, 6.65.2, 7.75.6). The current Sutta seems to draw on the conception of Rohita in Atharvaveda 13, glorifying Agni as the Sun, who “arrives in a flash” (13.2.15), “swift” (13.2.2), “rushing” (13.2.19), “traversing the sky” (13.2.22), radiating as far as worlds extend (13.2.42, 13.2.10, 13.1.16), racing over the world never letting his thought stray (13.2.15). The “Sun’s bay horses” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sūryasyāśvā harayaḥ</i>, 13.1.24) are seven ruddy steeds who carry it, spreading out its rays (13.2.4, 13.3.16). ",

  "sn2.26:3.3": "It has been pointed out that a swift arrow can fly at 250 f/s, which would take 0.008 seconds to cross the width of a palm trunk of two feet. India ocean to ocean is about 2400 km. To cross it in 0.008 seconds would require a velocity of around 300,000 km/s. ",
