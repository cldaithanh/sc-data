  "sn2.9:1.1": "This discourse and the next provide the Buddhist community with verses to recite for solace on the terrifying occasion of an eclipse. ",
  "sn2.9:1.2": "Rāhu (“seizer”), is able to swallow the Moon and Sun because he has largest physical body of any creature (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.15/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 4.15:2.1</a>). This also lets him divert the rains (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.197/en/sujato#3.1'>AN 5.197:3.1</a>). This myth is alluded to in Atharvaveda 19.9.10a and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.13.1. An eclipse was a day unfit for study (Manu 4.110). The full story of Rāhu, however, is not told until the Purāṇas, so this Sutta is possibly the oldest telling that survives. ",
  "sn2.9:1.3": "Candimā, the “moon” as celestial body or deity, appears frequently in the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.24.10, 1.102.2, etc.). A slightly different form of this name appears in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.11/en/sujato'>SN 2.11</a>. ",
  "sn2.9:2.3": "The later Purāṇic legend says that Rāhu disguised himself as a brahmin to drink the gods’ nectar of immortality. But he was spied by the Sun and Moon, decapitated by Vishnu, and now his disembodied head traverses the skies as a black planet. He does not forget how the Sun and Moon betrayed him, so, nursing his enmity, he swallows them when he can. He is ever frustrated as they simply pass out through his throat. ",
  "sn2.9:2.4": "Here the sense of “refuge” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saraṇa</i>) is both physical and spiritual. ",
  "sn2.9:5.1": "Rāhu was the son of Vepacitti and, according to Purāṇic legend, Siṁhikā. ",
  "sn2.9:7.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Abhigīta</i> first appears with regards to a drop of Soma that has been “chanted over”, “besung”, or “enchanted” and hence imbued with potency (Rig Veda 9.96.23). Throughout Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 8.5.4 it is used more prosaically: a history of horse sacrifices is listed, each event honored with a specific verse “sung about” it. In Pali, the phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāthābhigīta</i> is found only in this passage and when the Buddha refused to eat food “chanted over” by a brahmins (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn7.8/en/sujato#8.1'>SN 7.8:8.1</a>). In both cases the chanting has a mysterious potency, so I render “enchanted with verse”. "
