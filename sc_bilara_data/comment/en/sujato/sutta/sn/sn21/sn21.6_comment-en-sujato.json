  "sn21.6:1.2": "Bhaddiya’s enlightenment came when being taught by Sāriputta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud7.1/en/sujato'>Ud 7.1</a>), who, however, underestimated him and kept teaching anyway (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud7.2/en/sujato'>Ud 7.2</a>). His verses are at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag7.2/en/sujato'>Thag 7.2</a>. He was declared as the monk with the most charming voice (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.194/en/sujato'>AN 1.194</a>). This discourse, with different verses, is also at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud7.5/en/sujato'>Ud 7.5</a> ",
  "sn21.6:2.2": "Read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pasatamigā</i>, where <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pasata</i> is Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛṣata</i>, “spotted”. ",
  "sn21.6:3.4": "It is this verse that establishes Bhaddiya as a small person, hence the commentaries say <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lakuṇṭaka</i> means “dwarf”. I follow the tradition, but it is weakly attested. It does not appear elsewhere and has no Sanskrit cognate (unless it is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lākuṭika</i>, “staff-bearer”). Sanskrit texts rather have <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lavaṇabhadrika</i> (“Handsome Bhadda”), which might not be a mistake, but rather a reformed epithet indicating his true beauty. "
