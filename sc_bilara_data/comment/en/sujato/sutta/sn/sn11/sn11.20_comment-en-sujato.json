  "sn11.20:3.2": "Mātali deploys this epithet very precisely. Vāsava, originally meaning “wealthy one” is interpreted in Pali as the “houser” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#4.1'>SN 11.12:4.1</a>). Both senses draw on Indra’s bounty, which he generously bestows on his acolytes. Mātali implies that, since renunciates have no home, they must have been deficient in their worship. The narrative hinges on the shift from the Vedic religion of prosperity to the Buddhist value of letting go. ",
  "sn11.20:5.3": "“Prepared by others” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paraniṭṭhita</i>. The same phrase is at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig13.2/en/sujato#13.3'>Thig 13.2:13.3</a>, where it is spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pari-</i>, but I assume they should both be <i lang='pi' translate='no'>para</i> (“other”). Mendicants do not cook, but rely on what is cooked by others. "
