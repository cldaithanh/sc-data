  "sn11.12:1.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Maghavā</i> (“bounteous one”) is a common epithet of Indra (eg. Rig Veda 3.39.09a, Atharva Veda 8.4.19a, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 24.5.22). It is from the Vedic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>magha</i>, “gift, bounty”. The name Māgha, with the same meaning, is a name of Sakka at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.3/en/sujato'>SN 2.3</a>, while at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.5/en/sujato#1.3'>Snp 3.5:1.3</a> a brahmin student Māgha asks about generosity. Finally, the good king of <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn83/en/sujato'>MN 83</a> is named Maghadeva, “god of bounty”. The passage here attributes the name to his ancestry, but it goes on to praise his generosity. ",
  "sn11.12:2.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Purandara</i> (“Fortbreaker”) is another epithet (eg. Rig Veda 1.102.7). The Buddha reforms it to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Purindada</i> (“Firstgiver”) at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 11.12:2.1</a>. But Indra’s generosity is long renowned: “He is the able one, and he will be able for us—Indra who distributes the goods” (Rig Veda 1.10.6). ",
  "sn11.12:3.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sakka</i> (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>śakra</i>, the “able one”) was originally an epithet of Indra. | ",
  "sn11.12:4.1": "Vāsava means “endowed with wealth” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vasu</i>; see for example Rig Veda 1.9.9a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>indraṁ vasupatiṁ</i> “Indra, lord of wealth”). This passage, rather, plays on the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āvasatha</i> and calls him the “giver of a guesthouse”. Later Brahmanical texts enumerated eight Vasus, with Indra as their lord, who are reckoned among the thirty-three. ",
  "sn11.12:5.1": "“Thousand eyes” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahassakkha</i>, more commonly <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahassanetta</i> <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.9/en/sujato#2.3'>SN 11.9:2.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp2.12/en/sujato#5.4'>Snp 2.12:5.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag21.1/en/sujato#58.4'>Thag 21.1:58.4</a>). In the Rig Veda it describes the sparkle of the Soma, perhaps alluding to its visionary effects (9.60, 9.65.7). It is in this context that Indra, along with Vāyu, is first called “thousand-eyed” (1.23.3). It is also used for Agni, the fire with eyes all around (1.79.12, 10.79.5). | “Needs” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthā</i>) here recalls <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.8/en/sujato#5.1'>SN 11.8:5.1</a>.

  "sn11.12:6.1": "Sanskrit sources know his wife as Śacī (“the powerful”), daughter of the titan maiden Pulomā, who came to be known as Indrāṇī. The Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sujampati</i> (“Sujā’s husband”) evidently draws from Indra’s epithet <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śacīpati</i> (“lord of power”; Rig Veda 1.106.06, 4.30.17, 8.15.13). But as Śacī Paulomī she is also author of a Vedic hymn in her own right (10.159). There she gains power through the same oblation by which Indra gained his power in order to gain victory over her co-wives and husband (“only my will should my husband follow”; “I will rule widely over this hero and over his people”). Indra was evidently not threatened by a powerful woman and took her to wife. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sujā</i> should be considered the Pali spelling of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śacī</i>. These indomitable characters forged a harmonious relationship, as seen when they share domestic duties by working together at the loom (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud3.7/en/sujato#3.2'>Ud 3.7:3.2</a>).

  "sn11.12:7.1": "The concept of 33 gods goes back as far as Rig Veda 8.28.1. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2). The final pair are elsewhere said to be Dyaus (“Heaven” = Zeus) and Pṛthivī (“Earth”), or the twin Aśvins. ",
