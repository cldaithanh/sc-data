None of these, however, suit Sakka’s behavior—he was not the sort to blackmail a mate in time of need. And indeed, there was a benevolent side to Sambara’s power as well. It was said to induce sleep (Arthaśāstra 14.3.19, 14.3.43), which could be a way to ease Vepacitti’s pain. There is also a hint of its medicinal use, since several medicinal herbs are named after it.
