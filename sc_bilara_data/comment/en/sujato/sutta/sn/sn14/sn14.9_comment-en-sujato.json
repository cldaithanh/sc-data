  "sn14.9:1.2": "This integrates the factors feeling and contact from the internal pentad (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn14.4/en/sujato'>SN 14.4</a>). Compared with other presentations (such as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/sujato#16.1'>MN 18:16.1</a>), it appears to do so incorrectly; we would expect contact, then feeling, perception, thought, desire, passion, and gains. Another sequence at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#2.2.2'>DN 21:2.2.2</a> also appears confused. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#9.1'>DN 15:9.1</a> has name and form, then contact, feeling, craving, searching, and gaining.
