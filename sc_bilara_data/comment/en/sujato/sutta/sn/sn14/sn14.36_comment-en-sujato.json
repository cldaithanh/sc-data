  "sn14.36:1.2": "Said also of the aggregates (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.30/en/sujato'>SN 22.30</a>), and the senses (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.21/en/sujato'>SN 35.21</a>, 22), this template gets its own Saṁyutta (SN 26). | The first phrase in this template consistently has four terms, the final two of which (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhinibbatti</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātubhāva</i>) are synonyms appearing together in the stock definition of “rebirth” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.2/en/sujato#4.2'>SN 12.2:4.2</a>). The following phrase, however, only has three: arising (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppāda</i>), continuing (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ṭhiti</i>), and manifestation (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātubhāva</i>). I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhinibbatti</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātubhāva</i> as reinforcing synonyms, the purpose of which is to clarify that the phrase does, in fact, mean a new rebirth. The three phases then correspond to the rebirth, continuation of life, and passing away to be reborn anew, “the manifestation of regeneration”. "
