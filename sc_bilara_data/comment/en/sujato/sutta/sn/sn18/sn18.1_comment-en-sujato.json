  "sn18.1:1.3": "Rāhula was the Buddha’s son to his wife Bhaddakaccānā (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.245/en/sujato'>AN 1.245</a>). Rāhula’s going forth is related at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#54.1.1'>Kd 1:54.1.1</a>, and other important discourses with him include <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato'>MN 61</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn62/en/sujato'>MN 62</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn147/en/sujato'>MN 147</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.121/en/sujato'>SN 35.121</a>. In the latter he became an arahant, which he confirmed in his own words at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag4.8/en/sujato'>Thag 4.8</a>. Commentaries explain his name as meaning “bondage”, but it probably refers rather to being born under the influence of the dark star Rāhu (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.8/en/sujato'>SN 2.8</a>). The Buddha declared him the foremost of monks who desire training (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.209/en/sujato'>AN 1.209</a>). This is illustrated in this series of lessons through which Rāhula doggedly persists. His death is not noted in the early texts. ",
