  "sn19.9:1.9": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sūcaka</i> appears only here in Pali. His title echoes his punishment by needles (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sūci</i>) which worm their way in and out of his body just as he, as an “informant” (Arthaśāstra 2.8.29) wormed his way through society. Manu says his punishment was to be reborn with a stinking nose (Manu 11.50). As noted in the next Sutta, the informant reported to the “village head”. "
