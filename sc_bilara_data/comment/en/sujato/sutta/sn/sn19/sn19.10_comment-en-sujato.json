  "sn19.10:1.1": "The “gnomes” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kumbhaṇḍa</i>, Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kuṣmāṇḍa</i>, “pumpkin-belly”) were a race of lesser deities often depicted as pot-bellied, ugly and misshapen, though reckoned as subjects of the four great kings (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#9.13'>DN 20:9.13</a>). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kumbha</i> also means “pot” and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṇḍa</i> “testicle” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#25.4'>MN 56:25.4</a>). Compare the fiendish <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kumbhamuṣka</i> (“pot-scrotum”) of Atharva Veda 8.6.15, 11.9.17. Perhaps conflated with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kuṣumbha</i>, an insect’s venom-sack (Atharva Veda 2.32.6). ",
  "sn19.10:1.2": "While the humorously painful imagery here is clear, it is less clear that the literal sense “pot-balls” was meant in general for the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kumbhaṇḍa</i> as a deity. Here it is used adjectivally of a man. ",
  "sn19.10:1.6": "A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāmakūṭa</i> is a “village head” , so <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kūṭa</i> here means “summit” rather than its other sense of “fraud”, though the senses might be conflated. The commentary explains it as “an official who makes judgements”. The suffix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ka</i> in the form here (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāmakūṭaka</i>) must have its belittling sense like <i lang='pi' translate='no'>muṇḍakā samaṇakā</i> (“shavelings, fake ascetics”). Kauṭilya depicts the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>grāmakūṭa</i> as acting on the whispers of an informant (Arthaśāstra 4.4.9). Perhaps his testicles are the size of the pots of gold he made through extortion and blackmail. "
