  "sn6.2:10.1": "For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attakāma</i> (“desires self-knowledge”) see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn31/en/sujato#3.5'>MN 31:3.5</a>. ",
  "sn6.2:10.2": "These lines always appear in a Brahmanical context (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.21/en/sujato#11.1'>AN 4.21:11.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.62/en/sujato#12.1'>AN 7.62:12.1</a>), and it seems the Buddha is playing with two senses of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mahatta</i>. Normally it means “greatness” but it can also stand for the Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mahātman</i>, “great Self”. Read in that way the two phrases <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attakāma</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mahattamabhikaṅkhatā</i> would both mean “desiring the True Self” in the Upaniṣadic system. For the Buddha, they meant perfecting oneself through development. "
