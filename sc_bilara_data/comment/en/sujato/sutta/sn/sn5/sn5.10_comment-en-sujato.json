  "sn5.10:5.4": "Vajirā directly opposes the Upaniṣadic view that the Self underlying the diversity of experience is no mere convention, but the true reality masked by appearances. Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.15 and Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.15.1, where all beings are fixed in Divinity like spokes in the hub of a wheel. The Upaniṣads say that the Self or the mind is the charioteer and the body the chariot (Katha Upaniṣad 1.3.3–9, Maitrī Upaniṣad 2.6, Paiṅgala Upaniṣad 4.1). "
