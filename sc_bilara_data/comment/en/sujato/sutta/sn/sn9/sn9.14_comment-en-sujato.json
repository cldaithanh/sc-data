The commentary explains <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṇṇa</i> here as “reason” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāraṇa</i>). In each context, there is an apparently hidden circumstance that needs to be brought to light. I think it anticipates <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṇṇanā</i> in the sense of “commentary”, “explanation”; cf. English “gloss”. ",
