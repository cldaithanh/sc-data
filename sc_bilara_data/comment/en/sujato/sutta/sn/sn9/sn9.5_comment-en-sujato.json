  "sn9.5:1.3": "The same verse is spoken by a certain Vajjiputta (“Vajjian”) at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.119/en/sujato'>Thag 1.119</a>. The Pali commentary says this occurred shortly after the Buddha’s passing. Ānanda, still only a stream-enterer, was striving for arahantship before the First Council, but got caught up in consoling the distraught layfolk. The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya agrees, adding that Vajjiputta was Ānanda’s attendant at the time. Following the exhortation, Ānanda meditated till late at night, then mindfully lay down to rest. When his feet were lifted off the floor, but his head not yet on his pillow, he became awakened (Rockhill, <em>The Life of the Buddha</em>, p. 155). The Pali Vinaya recounts the same events, but does not mention this verse (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.6.1'>Kd 21:1.6.1</a>). ",
