The root is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mas</i> (“to rub”), suggesting the idea of examining with the fingers or “to probe”. ",
  "sn12.66:3.6": "“Attachment” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upadhi</i>, which is both the things of the world to which we cling, and the inner clinging (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.2/en/sujato'>Snp 1.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato#28.2.'>MN 105:28.2.</a>). The Jains defined <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upadhi</i> similarly (Tattvārthasūtra 9.26). The dominant meaning in Sanskrit is “fraud”, which perhaps informs the Buddhist sense: the things we attach to give a false sense of security. Here it plays the role of “grasping” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādāna</i>). ",

  "sn12.66:13.10": "The drinks are <i lang='pi' translate='no'>surā</i> (beer), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dadhimaṇḍaka</i> (buttermilk or whey), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>maṭṭhaloṇikā</i> (salted whey or sour cream, i.e. lassi), and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>loṇasovīraka</i> (salted infusion of fermented barley and herbs). These correspond with drinks mentioned, along with others, in the Cāraka Saṁhita as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>surā</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mastu</i> (Hindi <i lang='pi' translate='no'>maṭṭhā</i>), <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dadhimaṇḍa</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sauvīraka</i>. These were fermented drinks used as purgatives, and some or all were also recreational liquors. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ayaṁ surāpipāsitā pānīyena vā vinetuṁ</i> seems corrupt, read: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ayaṁ pipāsā surāpānīyena vā vinetuṁ</i> (“to dispel this thirst by a drink of beer”). | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Loṇasovīraka</i> is allowed as medicine (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/sujato#5.33.14'>Bu Pj 3:5.33.14</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#16.3.1'>Kd 6:16.3.1</a>; preparation methods are given in Suśruta Saṁhitā 1.44 and commentary to Pj 3). It probably originated in Sovīra (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#36.6'>DN 19:36.6</a>). Sanskrit just has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sauvīraka</i> but Cāraka Saṁhita 3.1.18 says it can be drunk with salt; salted drinks are still popular in India. It was a great favorite of the hard-partying women of Madra, who, it was said, would sooner part with husband or son than a drop of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sauvīraka</i> (Mahābhārata 8.30). | The last phrase is corrupt, read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ahitāya dukkhāya</i> following PTS and Bodhi.
