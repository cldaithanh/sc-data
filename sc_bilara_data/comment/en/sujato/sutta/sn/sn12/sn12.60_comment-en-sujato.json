  "sn12.60:1.1": "This Nidānasutta opens in a way practically identical to the Mahānidānasutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato'>DN 15</a>). However, after the introduction it merely recapitulates the teachings from the previous discourses, unlike the Mahānidānasutta which introduces a dazzling range of unique perspectives. It is hardly possible that Ānanda would make the same mistake twice, so it seems likely that the present discourse is an artificial composite. "
