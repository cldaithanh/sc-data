  "sn12.30:1.3": "“They will abide having transcended” is a unique phrase, reminiscent of language more commonly associated with eternalism (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.9.3'>DN 1:2.9.3</a>). Here refers to the perfected one, who abides in this world for the remainder of their lifespan, but has transcended rebirth. "
