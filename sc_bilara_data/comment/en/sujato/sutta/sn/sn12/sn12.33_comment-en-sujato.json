  "sn12.33:5.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhamme ñāṇaṁ</i> is the knowledge of the principles of the teaching that are apparent in the present life (cf. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>diṭṭheva dhamme</i>). It contrasts with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anvaye ñāṇaṁ</i>, knowledge inferred to the past and future. The pair, along with knowledge of others’ minds and conventional knowledge, are also at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.103'>DN 33:1.11.103</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.5.35'>DN 34:1.5.35</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/vb16/en/sujato#307.1'>Vb 16:307.1</a>. The two forms of knowledge are illustrated in the narrative of Vipassī (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.36.1'>DN 14:1.36.1</a>). ",
  "sn12.33:5.2": "The same phrase is found in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn42.11/en/sujato#2.9'>SN 42.11:2.9</a>, which likewise discusses what is presently observable and what is inferred. Similar terms also describe one who realizes the Dhamma as a stream-enterer (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#18.8'>MN 56:18.8</a>). ",
  "sn12.33:7.2": "This knowledge “inferred” from the principles of the teaching allows Sāriputta to state that there has never been, nor ever will be, anyone more enlightened than the Buddha, even though he cannot read the minds of all the Buddhas (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12/en/sujato#6.2'>SN 47.12:6.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.17.8'>DN 16:1.17.8</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#2.2'>DN 28:2.2</a>). Pasenadi likewise “infers from the teaching” that the Buddha is awakened due to his behavior and that of the Saṅgha; since Pasenadi was not enlightened, this is not a special faculty of awakening (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#13.17'>MN 89:13.17</a>). Nonetheless, a fool like Sunakkhatta cannot infer in this way (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#5.1'>MN 12:5.1</a>). In all of these cases, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhamma</i> has the primary meaning of “teaching”, but in particular, the principles of the teaching that are observable (see especially <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#2.14'>DN 28:2.14</a>).
