  "sn12.18:4.1": "The feeling is believed to be an inalienable property of the eternal Self who feels. Though eternalism is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied by the parallel construction of this discourse with the previous, except with feeling and the feeler rather than deed and the experiencer. In that discourse, the phrase “for one who has existed since the beginning” is part of the eternalist view, not the annihilationist, and the same is true here. See <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#8.8'>MN 2:8.8</a> and note there. "
