  "sn12.61:1.3": "The technical term “body made up of the four principal states” clarifies that it is the material body spoken of here, rather than, say, the “mental body” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#20.2'>DN 15:20.2</a>). ",
  "sn12.61:1.6": "A number of non-Buddhist religious teachers were said to be “free of desire for sensual pleasures” through developing absorption meditation (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#13.7'>AN 6.54:13.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato#11.1'>AN 7.66:11.1</a>). This would probably include the Buddha’s former teachers. Such freedom is temporary, however, as without severing the root-level attachments the desire will eventually resurface. ",
  "sn12.61:2.1": "The terms “mind” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>citta</i>), “sentience” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mano</i>), and “consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>) are broadly synonymous and in many cases may be substituted for one another. Nonetheless, they each have a particular context in which they predominate. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Citta</i> is to be developed, in which respect it pertains to the fourth noble truth, the path. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Mano</i>, which I translate here as “sentience” for the sake of disambiguation, is often used in the active sense of the deeds done by the mind, pertaining to the second noble truth, the origin of suffering. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Viññāṇa</i> is the key factor in the experince of suffering, pertaining to the first noble truth.
