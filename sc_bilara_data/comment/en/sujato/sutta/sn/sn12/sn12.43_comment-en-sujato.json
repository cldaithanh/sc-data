  "sn12.43:2.2": "This discourse (and the next two) begin with consciousness in the process of sense stimulation. They offer a compressed sequence that focuses on the arising of suffering in the present life, and how by letting go craving it is possible to not generate a future life. ",
  "sn12.43:2.4": "The text jumps straight from craving to suffering, although the full sequence is stated in the cessation series. The next discourse, which is otherwise similar, lists all the factors, and the one after that goes to grasping, then indicates an abbreviation. I think the full sequence is meant in every case, and the sign of abbreviation in the Pali text is missing by mistake. ",
  "sn12.43:4.5": "Craving can cease without leading to grasping for one practicing the path. "
