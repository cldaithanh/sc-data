  "sn12.21:1.2": "The purpose of this discourse (and the next) seems to be to extol dependent origination as a special insight of the Buddha. But it does so artlessly, simply plonking down a series of teachings without connecting them in any way. Editors and translators have tried to smooth it over, but I translate as-is. | The ten powers (of a Realized One) are explained at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#9.1'>MN 12:9.1</a>, where they are followed by the four kinds of self-assurance (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#22.1'>MN 12:22.1</a>). The powers are found independently at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.21/en/sujato'>AN 10.21</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.22/en/sujato'>AN 10.22</a>, and are claimed by Anuruddha at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn52.15/en/sujato'>SN 52.15</a>–24. The four kinds of self-assurance are at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.8/en/sujato'>AN 4.8</a>. | The “divine wheel” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>brahmacakka</i>) is a synonym for the “wheel of the teaching” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhammacakka</i>). In Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 1.6, the same term refers to the circle of existence in which all things live. ",
  "sn12.21:1.3": "This is a recommended meditation (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato#38.4'>MN 10:38.4</a>) leading to perfection (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23/en/sujato#1.4'>SN 12.23:1.4</a>). In one place it exemplifies the Buddha’s teaching, but there it follows organically and is marked as quote (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.78/en/sujato#2.2'>SN 22.78:2.2</a>). Here it is simply pasted in after the previous passage. It does not offer an integration between the aggregates and dependent origination; they simply appear side by side. ",
  "sn12.21:1.8": "This is the abstract principle of dependent origination; see discussion at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.37/en/sujato#2.2'>SN 12.37:2.2</a>. Again there is no textual link with the previous passages. "
