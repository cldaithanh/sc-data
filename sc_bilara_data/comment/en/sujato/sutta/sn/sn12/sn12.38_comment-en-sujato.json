The twelve factors are grouped under three headings: ignorance, craving, and grasping are “defilements” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilesavaṭṭa</i>); choices and continued existence are “deeds” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kammavaṭṭa</i>); the remainder are “results” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vipākavaṭṭa</i>). Within these groups we different synonyms or related terms are used in particular contexts (see eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.19/en/sujato'>SN 12.19</a>).
