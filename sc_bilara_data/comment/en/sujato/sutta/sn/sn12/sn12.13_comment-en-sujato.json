  "sn12.13:1.2": "The terms “ascetics and brahmins” is often used as a generic catch-all for ‘religious practitioners” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.1/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 3.1:2.1</a>). | “Ascetics” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samaṇa</i>) include the renunciate practitioners of the non-Vedic religions such as the Buddhists, Jains, and Ājīvakas. Such religious movements typically rejected Vedic authority and caste system, and proposed their own philosophy and practice (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#2.2'>DN 2:2.2</a>). | “Brahmins” were a hereditary caste of Vedic priests charged with maintaining scripture and performing rituals. In the Vedas, brahmins served worldly prosperity and, more vaguely, heavenly rebirth. Perhaps under the influence of the ascetics, they later developed a renunciate movement of contemplatives who looked for a merger with Divinity beyond the cycle of rebirth. ",
  "sn12.13:1.13": "Literally, “they are not deemed by me as ascetics among ascetics, or brahmins among brahmins”. The Buddha recognized these terms as spiritually valid, even if the individuals sometimes do not live up to them. This distinction is not uniquely Buddhist, for we find it among the Jains (eg. Uttarādhyayana Sūtra 17) and brahmins (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.10). "
