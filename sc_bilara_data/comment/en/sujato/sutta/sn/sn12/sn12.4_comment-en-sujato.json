  "sn12.4:1.2": "The story of Vipassī is detailed in the Mahāpadāna Sutta, with which this passage is mostly shared (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#2.18.5'>DN 14:2.18.5</a>). In early texts, Vipassī is always mentioned with the full group of seven Buddhas (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag7.5/en/sujato'>Thag 7.5</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#3.2'>DN 32:3.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#3.1.6'>Bu Pj 1:3.1.6</a>). | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bodhisatta</i> is explained by the commentary here as either “one possessed of awakening”, or one who is certain of awakening in the proximity of Buddhahood. The latter explanation allows a reading equivalent to Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bodhiśakta</i> (“one intent on awakening”), rather than the more familiar <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bodhisattva</i> (“awakening-being”).

  "sn12.4:2.2": "This phrasing corresponds to the abstract principle of dependent origination (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.37/en/sujato#2.2'>SN 12.37:2.2</a>). Compare Śaunaka’s question at Muṇḍaka Upoaniṣad 1.2.3:  “When what is understood, sir, is all this understood?” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kasmin nu bhagavo vijñāte sarvaṁ idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati</i>).

  "sn12.4:2.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Yoniso maniskāra</i> (“rational application of mind”) is a distinctively Buddhist term that literally means “applying the mind by way of source”. It is mostly used in investigating causality, although over time it came to have a more general sense of “reflection, inquiry, attention”. ",
  "sn12.4:11.4": "Here we have the normal twelve links, whereas in DN 14 the sequence omits ignorance and choices, emphasizing rather the mutual interdependence of consciousness with name and form, a variation found also in the context of Gotama’s awakening at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65/en/sujato'>SN 12.65</a>.
