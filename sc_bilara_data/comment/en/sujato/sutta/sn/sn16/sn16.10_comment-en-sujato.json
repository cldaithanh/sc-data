  "sn16.10:1.5": "A certain tension arose between the strict Mahākassapa and the more open Ānanda after the Buddha’s passing. At the First Council, Ānanda was repeatedly admonished by senior monks apparently siding with Kassapa (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.10.2'>Kd 21:1.10.2</a>). ",

  "sn16.10:3.2": "Ānanda was from Sakya, not Videha, a problem that evidently vexed the commentators. The Pali commentaries explains <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedeha</i> as “learned”, or say his mother was from Videha. The Mahāvastu, on the other hand, says that after the Buddha went forth, Ānanda went to Videha and undertook a vow of silence (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maunavrata</i>, Mvu 83; Senart 3.176). The Mūlasarvastivāda Vinaya says rather that it was on Mount Videha that the Buddha entrusted Ānanda with the design for the robes (Mu Kd 7; GBM 6.814). None of these are cogent. The point is that Thullatissā was such an idiot, she didn’t even know where Ānanda came from. ",
