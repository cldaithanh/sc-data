  "sn10.5:1.1": "The commentary explains that Sānu was a disillusioned novice who had returned home planning to disrobe. | Sānu was perhaps named after the planet Saturn (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śani</i>; cf. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn10.7/en/sujato'>SN 10.7</a>). The Sanskrit word for planet (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>graha</i>, cf. Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gayha</i> at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#17.3'>DN 20:17.3</a>) shows their role as “seizers”. The later Suśrutasaṁhitā-uttaratantra details the entities that cause such seizures in children (60), corresponding to the nine planets (27). Seizures or fits were treated as medical, spiritual, and astrological in cause and remedy. ",
  "sn10.5:1.2": "Elsewhere we find possession by Māra expressed as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anvāviṭṭha</i>, literally “inhabited”, where the victims are made to behave badly but are otherwise normal (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.18/en/sujato#1.4'>SN 4.18:1.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#14.2'>MN 50:14.2</a>; cf. Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āviṣṭa</i>). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Gahita</i> here is also used for Rāhu “seizing” the Sun and Moon (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.10/en/sujato#1.2'>SN 2.10:1.2</a>). The commentary says he was shaking on the ground, eyes rolling and mouth foaming, i.e. having a “seizure”. This was not ill-motivated, for the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkha</i> was trying to prevent him from disrobing. Compare those who, though “seized by a gandharva” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharvagṛhīta</i>), remain perfectly cogent (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.3.1, 3.7.1). ",

  "sn10.5:6.2": "It’s interesting that the Buddha cites a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkha</i> saying to someone recovering from a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkha</i>-induced seizure. At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig12.1/en/sujato#12.1'>Thig 12.1:12.1</a> these lines are attributed to the nun Puṇṇikā. ",

  "sn10.5:9.1": "Here’s the plot twist: the mother’s real worry is not the seizure, but that her son will fall prey to desire and suffering. See <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn20.10/en/sujato#3.5'>SN 20.10:3.5</a>, “For it is death in the training of the Noble One to reject the training and return to a lesser life.” ",
  "sn10.5:10.3": "This is, I think, the only case in the EBTs where “inferno” might be suggested for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>naraka</i>. Elsewhere in early Pali, however, it means “cliff, abyss” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#5.9'>MN 49:5.9</a>, mn86:6.15](), <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#28.4'>Snp 3.11:28.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag16.8/en/sujato#4.2'>Thag 16.8:4.2</a>).
