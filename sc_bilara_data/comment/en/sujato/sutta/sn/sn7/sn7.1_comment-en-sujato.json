She is perhaps the same person, although the setting and most of the narrative details are different. | The two names have the same sense: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhāradvāja</i> is the “swift plunderer of booty”, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhanañjānī</i> is the “winner of wealth”, an epithet of Indra (and the name of a tariff-skimming brahmin at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn97/en/sujato#2.13'>MN 97:2.13</a>). These recall a much earlier age, when a raider on horseback or chariot would descend on villages and make off with the booty.
