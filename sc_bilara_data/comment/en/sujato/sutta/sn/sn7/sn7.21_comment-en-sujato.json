  "sn7.21:1.2": "A Saṅgārava of Sāvatthī appears in a number of discourses, and his spiritual progression can be traced. Here he practices purification in water, and (apparently later) asked the Buddha about sacrifice (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.60/en/sujato'>AN 3.60</a>). He further asked how hymns are remembered (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn46.55/en/sujato'>SN 46.55</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.193/en/sujato'>AN 5.193</a>). In all these discourses he was said to have gone for refuge at the end. Finally he asks the more meaningful spiritual question about the near shore and far shore (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.117/en/sujato'>AN 10.117</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.169/en/sujato'>AN 10.169</a>). It is possible that the teenage “student” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>māṇava</i>) Saṅgārava living at Caṇḍalakappa (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato'>MN 100</a>) graduated and moved to nearby Sāvatthī where he became known as the “brahmin” Saṅgārava. This would only make sense, however, if we disregard the statements on going for refuge, as he clearly followed the Brahmanical path for quite some time. ",
  "sn7.21:2.7": "This quasi-physical understanding of good and evil predates the Buddha, and is found among Jains as well. The practice of ritual bathing is also listed among the self-mortifications, but it seems to fit better here, as bathing in India is not unpleasant (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato#45.12'>MN 12:45.12</a>).
