  "sn7.12:1.6": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pakaṭṭhaka</i> (“drag”) is unique. Commentary glosses “greedy for tastes” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rasagiddha</i>).

  "sn7.12:2.2": "The “king of the heavens” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>devarājā</i>) is Indra, god of the rain and thunder. This clarifies the common Pali idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>devo vassati</i>, literally “the god rains”; the god is in fact Indra. In Pali this use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>deva</i> straddles the naturalistic and the religious. Often it is just an idiom expressing rainfall, while in other cases, as here, it has a religious connotation. For this reason I use “the heavens” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>deva</i> in such cases. It is a Vedic idiom (eg. Rig Veda 5.84.3 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>divo varṣanti</i>;  9.108.10 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛṣṭiṃ divaḥ pavasva</i>; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.3.1.16 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>divo varṣati</i>).
