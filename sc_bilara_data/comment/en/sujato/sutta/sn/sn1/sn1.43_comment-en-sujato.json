  "sn1.43:1.2": "Here the word for “food” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anna</i>, which is a major theme of Vedic texts. From their creation the gods needed food (Aitareya Upaniṣad 1.2.1). The Divinity created two kinds of food for the gods, namely that offered in the fire, and that offered for beings not in the fire (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>hutaṁ ca prahutaṁ ca</i>), or else the offerings at new and full moon (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.1–2). The point is that gods are dependent and hence not free. Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.2.1 says that all creatures on the earth are produced by food, and pass back into food, the eldest of creatures, while 3.6–10 honors food as the foundation of life. ",
  "sn1.43:1.3": "“Spirit” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkha</i>. In early texts it sometimes means “mysterious manifestation of divinity”. "
