  "sn1.39:1.3": "Pajjuna is Parjanya, the Vedic god of rain, especially the thunderstorm. His “lively drops” impregnate the earth, begetting plants (Rig Veda 5.83). While I cannot find a reference elsewhere to his daughter Kokanadā, it seems fitting that the daughter of the rain and the earth is the “Red Lotus”. ",
  "sn1.39:2.2": "Bodhi suggests taking the singular <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattassa</i> as a metrically shortened <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattānaṁ</i> (“beings”). However, there is a plural form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattāna</i> that is metrically identical with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattassa</i>. Perhaps Kokanadā is using <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i> here in the sense of “creation”. ",
  "sn1.39:4.3": "The commentaries identify this  <i lang='pi' translate='no'>roruva</i> (“Hell of Screams”) with the “Smoky Roruva”, while the “Great Hell of Screams”, mentioned as the destiny of a corrupt financier in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.20/en/sujato'>SN 3.20</a>, is the “Flaming Roruva”, said to be the same as Avīci. These are also known in the Sanskrit tradition, eg. Manu 4.88, and described in detail at eg. Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa 10, 12. There, the Ruarava of glowing coals is the destiny of the false witness and the liar, while Mahāraurava is scorching copper and ravenous beasts. ",
  "sn1.39:4.4": "Torment in the Mahāraurava lasts 100,000,000 years, according to the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. "
