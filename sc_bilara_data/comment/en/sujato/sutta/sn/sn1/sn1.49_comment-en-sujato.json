In standard Buddhist cosmology his realm stands above the gods of the Thirty-Three (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn97/en/sujato#30.18'>MN 97:30.18</a>), but here we would normally find the ghost realm (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pettivisaya</i>). His true role is as guardian to the paths or rivers that lead one from one life to another (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.33/en/sujato#10.3'>SN 1.33:10.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato#3.1'>MN 130:3.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp235/en/sujato'>Dhp 235</a>). He was the son of Vivasvant (the sun) and brother of Manu, and as the first person to die, Rig Veda 10.4 tells us that he discovered the paths to the lands of the dead that he now guards with his pair of hounds. Yama is a righteous god, but sinners see him as horrifying due to their own guilt (Brahma Purāṇa 106.46). ",
