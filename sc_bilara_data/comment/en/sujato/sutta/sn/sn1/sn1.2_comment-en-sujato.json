  "sn1.2:1.1": "From here, the Pali gives only the abbreviated setting or none at all. In such cases, we are meant to read the full introduction per <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.1/en/sujato'>SN 1.1</a>. ",
  "sn1.2:5.1": "The Buddha’s answer seems to mix a few lines of verse with some prose. This line is verse, as it has an unusual structure, best understood as due to the exigencies of metre, and where it occurs elsewhere it is always as verse. Also, this line and the next are metrical (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vatta</i>). The Chinese parallels at SA 1268 and SA-2 179 format the whole of the Buddha’s answer as prose, the verse being spoken by the deity at the end. Perhaps the Buddha quoted a couple of lines of verse in a prose sentence. ",
  "sn1.2:5.2": "With this the Buddha differentiates himself from Yājnavalkya, for whom perception (limited awareness) ends, but consciousness (infinite awareness) is eternal (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12). ",
  "sn1.2:5.3": "The Chinese parallels here speak of the liberation of the mind rather than the cessation of feelings. The textual problems seem insoluble and it appears the text is corrupt. "
