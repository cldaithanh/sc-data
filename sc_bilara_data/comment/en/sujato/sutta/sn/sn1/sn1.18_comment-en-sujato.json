  "sn1.18:1.3": "The reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apabodhati</i> is uncertain. It seems to be from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bodh</i>, which suggests the sense “be aware (of), be cognizant (of)”. This matches the answering verse, which speaks of mindfulness. The point is that by being aware of what is blameworthy they restrain themselves from it. "
