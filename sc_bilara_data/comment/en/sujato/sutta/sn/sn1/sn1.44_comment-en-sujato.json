  "sn1.44:1.1": "The exact meaning of these items is open to interpretation. See Bodhi’s note for two readings; I offer a third. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Āvaṭṭa</i> here might be read as “whirlpool”, “loop”, or “twist”. ",
  "sn1.44:1.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Patthara</i> is probably a “spread” of grass, such as was laid down in rituals. ",
  "sn1.44:1.3": "If the ocean is counted as the last item, the total is twelve. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dvādasa</i> can be an ordinal number. | I take the riddle as corresponding with the twelvefold “round” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṭṭa</i>) of dependent origination. The “one root” is ignorance; the “two loops” are name-and-form with consciousness (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#22.6'>DN 15:22.6</a>); the “three stains” are ignorance, craving, and grasping; the “five spreads” are perhaps the five consequents starting with consciousness; and the “ocean” is transmigration itself.
