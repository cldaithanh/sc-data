  "sn1.77:1.4": "“Pest” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abbuda</i>, literally “tumor”, “cancer”. Also an early stage of embryonic development (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn10.1/en/sujato#3.2'>SN 10.1:3.2</a>) and the name of a hell or a very large number (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.10/en/sujato#8.2'>Snp 3.10:8.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.10/en/sujato#6.2'>SN 6.10:6.2</a>). Originally the name of the snake Arbuda crushed beneath Indra’s foot, where he is mentioned along with other foes such as Vritra, Namuci, etc. (Rig Veda 1.51.6, 2.11.20, 2.14.4, 8.3.19, 8.32.3, 8.32.26, 10.67.12). As Arbuda Kādraveya he is, rather curiously, said to have composed Rig Veda 10.94, where he addresses the pressing stones. He is also invoked in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.4.3.9. "
