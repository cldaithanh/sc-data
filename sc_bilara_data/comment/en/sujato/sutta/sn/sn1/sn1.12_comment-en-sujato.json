  "sn1.12:3.3": "“Attachment” here is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upadhi</i>, which is both the things of the world to which we cling, and the inner clinging (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.2/en/sujato'>Snp 1.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.66/en/sujato'>SN 12.66</a>). The Jains defined <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upadhi</i> similarly (Tattvārthasūtra 9.26). The dominant meaning in Sanskrit is “fraud”, which perhaps informs the Buddhist sense: the things we attach to give a false sense of security. "
