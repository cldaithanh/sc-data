  "sn1.21:2.4": "Here, as often (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#22.3'>AN 6.54:22.3</a>), giving up <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāmarāga</i> implies attaining the absorptions. It cannot mean relinquishing the “underlying tendency” or the “fetter” to sensual desire, for this occurs only at the third stage of awakening (non-return), whereas the Buddha’s rejoinder urges rather to give up substantialist view, the first stage of awakening, the stream-enterer.

But <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.16/en/sujato#3.2'>SN 2.16:3.2</a> is the same as here. "
