  "sn1.13:2.3": "These lines closely mirror the question at Vājasaneyi Saṁhitā 23.47a (quoted at Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.5.2.13), “What light equals the sun? What lake equals the ocean?” The answers given in the next verse are “Brahmā” and “heaven”. ",
  "sn1.13:3.1": "The Theravada tradition, starting from the Vimuttimagga, begins the  meditation on love (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mettā</i>) by focusing on oneself, a practice that draws on passages such as this. See also <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.8/en/sujato'>SN 3.8</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud5.1/en/sujato'>Ud 5.1</a>. Here the Pali uses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pema</i> (“fondness”) rather than <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mettā</i> (“love”). "
