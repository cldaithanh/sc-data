  "sn17.6:1.3": "The phrasing here is odd, but the regular syntax in the two phrases (object in accusative, subject in nominative, verb in imperative), as well as the parallel phrasing in the next Sutta, argue against it being corrupt (as posited by Bodhi). I think the Buddha is quoting a curse, then he substitutes the Dhammic meaning. Compare Atharva Veda 8.4.20: “Let Indra hurl his lightning at the sorcerers!”, where Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aśani</i> = Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>asani</i> (“lightning-bolt”). See the next Sutta and note. | For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>asanivicakka</i> (“forked lightning”) see Rig Veda 4.35.2, where <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicakra</i> means “divided”. This phrase is only used in one other place in the canon, which is also about a decadent monk (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn25/en/sujato#11.3'>DN 25:11.3</a>). "
