Given that the next step is the entire earth, perhaps <i lang='pi' translate='no'>siṅgīnikkha</i> means “golden mountain”. A “golden mountain” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pabbatassa suvaṇṇassa</i>) appears in a similar context at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.20/en/sujato#3.2'>SN 4.20:3.2</a>. "
