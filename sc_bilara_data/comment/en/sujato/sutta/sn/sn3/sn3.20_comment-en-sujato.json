  "sn3.20:3.2": "The concept of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccekabuddha</i> allows that there were awakened sages in the long periods of time when there is no <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambuddha</i> such as Gotama. Both are Buddhas in the sense of being awakened, but they differ in their relation to others. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.3/en/sujato'>Snp 1.3</a>). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn116/en/sujato'>MN 116</a>, 500 dwell on the same hill, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacceka</i> Brahmās appear in pairs (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.6/en/sujato#1.3'>SN 6.6:1.3</a>). Compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np9/en/sujato#1.36.1'>Bu NP 9:1.36.1</a>, where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an11.16/en/sujato#11.2'>AN 11.16:11.2</a>. Likewise, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.37/en/sujato#1.7'>SN 1.37:1.7</a> speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacceka</i> means “independent’, which here has the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently.
