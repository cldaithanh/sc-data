  "sn3.1:1.3": "Pasenadi, son of Sañjaya Mahākosala, ruled the nation of Kosala from its capital Sāvatthī until his death shortly before the Buddha. Like the Buddha’s family, he claimed descent from the Solar lineage of Okkāka. He features throughout the Suttas as a well-meaning if sometimes naive ruler. During his realm, Kosala was a flourishing trade center with a vibrant religious life, a center not just for Buddhists but for Vedic brahmins and Jains, as well as local religious customs. ",
  "sn3.1:1.4": "Pasenadi’s polite but not reverential behavior indicates that he is not yet a devotee of the Buddha. This may, in fact, record their first meeting. ",

We have met four of these already in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.30/en/sujato'>SN 2.30</a>, which gives a summary of their teachings. As for the remaining two, Sañjaya’s method of radical avoidance is taught at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#32.2'>DN 2:32.2</a>, while Ajita’s materialistic denial of merit is at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#23.2'>DN 2:23.2</a>.

  "sn3.1:8.2": "This is an allusion to the venomous bite, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tejas</i> having roots in both “sharp” and “fiery”. This metaphor is the origin of the dragon’s fiery breath. For a fiery dragon defeated by the Buddha, whose flames are even more multi-colored, see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#15.1.1'>Kd 1:15.1.1</a>.

It is, ironically, due to the very perfection of their virtue that any harmful deed done against them reaps a painful karmic result. ",
  "sn3.1:14.4": "This marks the point at which Pasenadi becomes a follower of the Buddha. The Buddha persuaded him, not through talk on profound philosophy or deep meditation, but with practical advice that is useful for him as a ruler. "
