Here he talks of how he sees this corruption in his court. he speaks further of his frustrations at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#13.1'>MN 98:13.1</a>. | Read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍa</i> (variants <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṭṭa</i>) which in Sanskrit has the senses “solve, infer, argue, discern”. The commentary interprets <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍakaraṇa</i> as the “place of judgement” i.e. the court, which is clearly the case at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.11.1'>DN 17:1.11.1</a>.

  "sn3.7:1.5": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhadramukha</i> is used here by by a king of his grown son. Elsewhere, by a family for a child (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn40/en/sujato#6.2'>MN 40:6.2</a>); by lay people addressing monks (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#21.1'>MN 81:21.1</a>); by a laywoman addressing a deity (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.53/en/sujato#3.4'>AN 7.53:3.4</a>);  (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.7/en/sujato#1.5'>SN 3.7:1.5</a>); and, with the addition of the familiar <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāta</i>, by a brahmin wife to her husband (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato#3.5'>MN 100:3.5</a>). The term is of Sanskritic form and is found commonly in the Avadāna literature. Turning to later Sanskrit sources, Nāṭyaśāstra 19.12 says it should be used when addressing inferiors, while Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.154 says it is used when addressing a prince (see SN 3.7 above). The early Pali usage, however, suggests it was an affectionate and respectful term of somewhat elevated usage, but not restricted by status. Since <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhadda</i> by itself is a common form of address in the sense “my dear”, I think the suffix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-mukha</i> has its intensive sense here, “dearest”, rather than “dear face”.
