  "sn3.18:3.1": "“Townsville” is a literal rendering of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nagaraka</i>. I translate it in homage to the town in northern Queensland where a chance encounter with a joey set me on the path to the Dhamma. The event the Buddha refers to here is recorded at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn45.2/en/sujato'>SN 45.2</a>. "
