  "sn3.8:1.2": "In addition to conversations on the theme of attachment to loved ones (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn87/en/sujato'>MN 87</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud5.1/en/sujato'>Ud 5.1</a>), unrelated incidents with Mallikā appear at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.197/en/sujato'>AN 4.197</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc53/en/sujato#1.1'>Bu Pc 53:1.1</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/sujato#1.2.7'>Bu Pc 83:1.2.7</a>. She is listed as an eminent lay disciple (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.91-117/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 8.91–117:1.1</a>) and maintained a monastery for philosophical debates (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn78/en/sujato#1.3'>MN 78:1.3</a>). Her passing is recorded at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.49/en/sujato'>AN 5.49</a>. This is what we know of her from early texts, while later Jātakas and other scriptures tell many colorful tales about her and her unique marriage. | Śvetāmbara Jains hold that, in the far distant past, the nineteenth founding teacher (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tīrthaṅkara</i>) was the lady Malli (Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra 6.6). Perhaps the Buddhist stories of the wise lady Mallikā helped inspire this legend. ",
  "sn3.8:1.4": "This passage echoes Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.8: “The Self is more dear than a son, than wealth, than everything else.” The reason, it argues, is that only the Self is immortal, not those who are dear. Pasenadi is of course using “self” in a conventional rather than metaphysical sense. ",
  "sn3.8:1.5": "Mallikā’s reply is brave, given that she is telling her king and husband she loves herself more than him. This passage alludes to the famous dialogue where Yājñavalkya explains to his wife Maitreyī that he is renouncing in order to seek the true Self. ",
  "sn3.8:4.3": "Care for oneself is not selfishness. This is an expression of the Golden Rule. "
