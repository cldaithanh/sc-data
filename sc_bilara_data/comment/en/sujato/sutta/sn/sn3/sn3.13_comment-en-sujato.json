In the Arthaśāstra it measures feed for horses (2.30.12) and elephants (2.15.50). One <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i> was the monthly allotment of grain for a servant (Manu 7.126). Olivelle estimates it at 5 liters or 9.6 kg (<em>King, Governance, and Law</em>, appendix 2, pg. 458). | The use of present tense (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhuñjati</i>) here indicates that it is an ongoing situation, not just a single large meal (compare the aorist in the previous Sutta).

Olivelle estimates the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>prastha</i> at around 600g, which is indeed one sixteenth of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i>.
