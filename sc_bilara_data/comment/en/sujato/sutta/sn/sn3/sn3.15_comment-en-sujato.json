  "sn3.15:1.8": "The background is explained in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja239/en/sujato'>Ja 239</a>. Pasenadi’s father, Mahākosala, had forged an alliance by marrying his daughter to Bimbisāra, endowing her with the revenues of a Kāsi village. Ajātasattu gained the throne by murdering his father, and the queen—Pasenadi’s sister Kosaladevī—died of grief soon after. So when he claimed the village, Pasenadi was outraged at the thought of his father’s gift going to such a man. He took the village, and the series of back-and-forth battles began. ",

  "sn3.15:8.1": "The idiom here is tricky. Bodhi has, “The fool thinks fortune is on his side”. The commentary glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ṭhāna</i> with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāraṇa</i> (“reason”). I think <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ṭhāna</i> (“solid ground”) here sets up the “fall” at the end of the verse. ",
  "sn3.15:9.1": "The Buddha speaks of the tendency for evil conduct to be passed down through generations, a fate that was to befall Ajātasattu himself. "
