  "ja78:1.1": "A rich man was so miserly that Sakka took on his form, crippled though it was, to open the miser’s vaults for the people. The king is asked to adjudicate his case, but cannot tell which is which. ",

This is still popular for eating in modern times, and as a result is threatened by overfishing, pollution, and global warming. | The commentary repeatedly calls him “miserly” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>macchariya</i>), suggesting that his name arose as a play on “fish” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maccha</i>). His misadventures, in fact, were sparked by seeing a man eating rotten fish (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pūtimacchaka</i>). "
