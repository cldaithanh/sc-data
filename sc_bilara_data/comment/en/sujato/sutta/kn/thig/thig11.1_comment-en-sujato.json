  "thig11.1:7.3": "The parallel verse at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.5/en/sujato#2.3'>SN 5.5:2.3</a> has, “There is no-one to whom you are second in the element of beauty” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>na catthi te dutiyā vaṇṇadhātu,</i>). The two lines use <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dutiya</i> (“second”) in different senses, as the ordinal number, and as “companion”. The Therīgāthā commentary offers two explanations, the second of which appears to lean on a version of the line similar to that found in SN 5.5. This, together with the fact that the unusual term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṇṇadhātu</i> in that line seems like a direct reference to her name, suggests that the SN version may be the original one.
