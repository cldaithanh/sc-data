  "thag8.3:2.4": "“Lady Luck” is Siri, later famed as goddess of fortune and prosperity. The same idiom recurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#5.9'>MN 49:5.9</a>. As to why someone would ward her off, Siri (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śrī</i>) is identified with Lakṣmī “the undeparting” (Śrī Sūkta 2, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lakṣmīmanapagāminīm</i>). Atharva Veda 7.115 opens with, “Fly away wicked Lakṣmī, vanish, fly hence”. Apparently 101 Lakṣmīs attach to a man when born, and the spell chases away the wicked (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāpi</i>) while keeping the good (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>puṇya</i>). In this case the Pali text does not draw directly from the Veda, as there is no close verbal parallel, and the Pali presents as irrational an action that makes good sense in the context of the Vedic passage. Rather, it would seem, the Pali draws from a more general cultural awareness. "
