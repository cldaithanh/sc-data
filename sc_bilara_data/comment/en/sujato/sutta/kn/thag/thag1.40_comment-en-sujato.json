  "thag1.40:1.1": "This Vaḍḍhamāna is unknown elsewhere. According to the commentary, as a layman, he committed such an offence that the Buddha resorted to the rather extreme means of overturning the bowl against him, “like stepping on a fire”. He repented, asked forgiveness, and later ordained. But he was lazy so the Buddha urged him with this verse. The commentary says he was born in royal Licchavī family of Vesālī. The Jain founder Mahāvīra Vardhamāna was said to have been born near Vesālī, and his mother was a Licchavī. Perhaps this verse was intended to belittle the Jain founder, but the commentary does not link the two. "
