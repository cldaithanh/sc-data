This story echoes Taittiriya Āraṇyaka 1.7.1.3, which tells how the sage Kaśyapa, the eighth above the seven Sūryas, dwells constantly on Mount Meru, never leaving, while the other Suns illuminate different regions. Sages have gone as far as the regions around, but none reached the mountain itself. "
