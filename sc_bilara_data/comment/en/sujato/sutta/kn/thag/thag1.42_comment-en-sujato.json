  "thag1.42:1.1": "These are the three sisters whose verses are recorded respectively at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.6/en/sujato'>SN 5.6</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig7.2/en/sujato'>Thig 7.2</a>; <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.7/en/sujato'>SN 5.7</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig7.3/en/sujato'>Thig 7.3</a>; <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.8/en/sujato'>SN 5.8</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig8.1/en/sujato'>Thig 8.1</a>, with some confusion in the attributions. | The names are feminine vocative singular. Rhys Davids and Norman translated them as masculine following the commentary, despite the grammatical implausibility and the absence of any such male group of three elsewhere. True, there is a Cāla and Upacāla mentioned at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.72/en/sujato#1.2'>AN 10.72:1.2</a>, but despite the text’s claim, all the monks there are otherwise unknown. "
