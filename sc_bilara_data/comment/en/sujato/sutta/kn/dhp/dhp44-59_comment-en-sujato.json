  "dhp44:1": "The verbs <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicessati</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacessati</i> in this verse appear to be unique. I take them to be from the Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ceṣṭ</i> (“move, explore”) rather than <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ci</i> (“gather”). They can then be read as present tense, which makes better sense of the verse. Sanskrit and Gandhari parallels have a variety of forms, all of which maintain the distinction between the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vi</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pa</i> prefixes. | I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicessati</i> in the sense “stir, agitate”, with reference to such passages as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.69/en/sujato#15.1'>AN 7.69:15.1</a>, where the noble one inspires the gods. The commentary, rather, suggests the sense “explore, investigate”. A variant reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vijessati</i> yields the sense “shall conquer”. ",
  "dhp44:3": "The verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacessati</i> is exceedingly rare, but the late tantric text Sarvatathāgatādhiṣṭhāna Vyūhasūtra has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>praceṣṭavyaḥ</i>, evidently in the sense of “setting out” scents, flowers, etc. on a shrine. Compare the sense of “having prepared” (the offering for the fire, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ceṣṭitvā</i>) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.19. "
