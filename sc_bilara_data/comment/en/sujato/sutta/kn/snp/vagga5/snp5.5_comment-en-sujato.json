  "snp5.5:3.4": "Niddesa treats <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāti</i> only as “rebirth” and does not connect it with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pabhava</i> in the sense of “origin”. Commentary glosses with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jātikāraṇa</i>, which at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.24/en/sujato#4.4'>SN 3.24:4.4</a> glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jātipaccaya</i> , where it must mean “by reason of birth”. ",
  "snp5.5:7.4": "Taking <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nivesana</i> here as “dogma”, the same sense as in the Aṭṭhakavagga. Otherwise it might just mean “strong attachment”. ",
  "snp5.5:10.3": "The expression <i lang='pi' translate='no'>taṁ taṁ namassāmi</i> also occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp5.6/en/sujato#3.3'>Snp 5.6:3.3</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja159/en/sujato#1.3'>Ja 159:1.3</a>. In each case the context is similar: it is an address in second person, followed by a wish or aspiration. The commentary explains the phrase either as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tasmā taṁ</i> (“therefore I bow to you”) or as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>taṁ evarūpaṁ</i> (“I bow to you of such a kind”). The Niddesa ignores the doubled pronoun, which implies it did not give it any special significance (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/cnd8/en/sujato#93.1'>Cnd 8:93.1</a>). I take it as emphatic: “I bow especially to you”. "
