  "snp3.7:35.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Mukha</i> means originally “mouth”, hence “opening”, “entrance”; but also “face”, hence “front”, “foremost”. The fire is the foremost sacrifice, but fire is also a “mouth”, since “however much one may put into a fire, it burns it all up all” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14.8). This sense of “consume” or “subsume” is alive in these verses as well. For example, the Sāvitrī “subsumes” other hymns, for merely one line is equivalent to all three Vedas (BU 5.14.2). The sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mukha</i> as “entrance, introduction” also applies, since the fire sacrifice and the Sāvitrī are the things first learned by a new student (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.12). Fire is also the “first” creation, and hence the oldest of rituals (ŚB 6.1.1.11).  | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Yaññā</i> is a truncated genitive plural (“of sacrifices”). ",
  "snp3.7:35.2": "The Sāvitrī is a famous verse recited daily by brahmin priests at dawn: “Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights (Rig Veda 3.62.10, Jamison/Brereton). It was the “head” of metres (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>śiro gāyatryaḥ</i>, ŚB 8.6.2.3, 8.6.2.6), and was “praised as the foremost of recitations” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāyatrāṇy uktha mukhanai śaṁsanti</i>, Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 17.7.1). “Prayers”, furthermore, are born “from the mouth” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mukhato</i>, ŚB 11.5.4.17). The Sāvitrī is the chief exponent of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāyatrī</i> metre, by which it is sometimes known. The three-lined <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāyatrī</i> is the “first” of poetic styles, both technically—as it is the shortest from which others were derived (ŚB 1.3.4.6, 1.6.2.10)—and historically, as it dominated the Rig Veda but fell out of fashion later. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Chandas</i> can be either “meter” in general, or a metrical song of praise, especially a Vedic hymn (eg. ŚB 11.5.7.3). The Sāvitrī is a Vedic text, not a meter, so the latter meaning must apply here. It is a collective singular. ",
