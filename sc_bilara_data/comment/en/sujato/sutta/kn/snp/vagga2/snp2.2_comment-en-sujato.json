  "snp2.2:11.4": "The split compound <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amaraṁ tapaṁ</i> occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.1/en/sujato#5.2'>SN 4.1:5.2</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag3.1/en/sujato#1.4'>Thag 3.1:1.4</a>, while here we have <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarā bahū tapā</i>. The commentary explains that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> here is “immortality”, and the phrase means “fervent mortification aimed at immortality”. However, I find this unconvincing, one reason being that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> is an adjective (and thus must be glossed with an abstract noun in dative, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarabhāvatthāya</i>). It is simpler to assume Pali has an idiomatic sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> as “endless”, which occurs here, in the phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarāvikkhepa</i> (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.23.1'>DN 1:2.23.1</a>), and in the Niddesa’s <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarāvitakka</i> (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/cnd12/en/sujato#6.1'>Cnd 12:6.1</a>). Then <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarā</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bahū</i> are synonyms. I cannot find any use in Sanskrit that parallels this, but <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> is noted by Edgerton in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit as “a high number”. ",
  "snp2.2:13.1": "The concluding verses identify the “Kassapa” of the poem as the Buddha Kassapa of the past. The commentary says this was added at the Council. "
