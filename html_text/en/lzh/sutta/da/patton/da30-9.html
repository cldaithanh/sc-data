<h2>Chapter 9: The Three Catastrophes</h2>
<h3>The Four Measureless Eons</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc611'>SC 611</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are four periods that last a long time, that are measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc612'>SC 612</a>“What are the four? First is the gradual conflagration of the world. When it destroys the world, it’s a very long period that’s measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Second is the period of void after the world’s destruction. There’s no world for a very long time, and it extends for a great distance. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Third is the initial arising of heaven and earth. When the world is forming, it’s a very long period. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Fourth, the period after heaven and earth lasts after it forms is a very long time that’s measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc613'>SC 613</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The world has three catastrophes. What are the three? First is the catastrophe of fire. Second is the catastrophe of water. Third is the catastrophe of wind. There are three upper limits to these catastrophes. What are the three? First is the Ābhāsvara Heaven. Second is the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. Third is the Bṛhatphala Heaven. The catastrophe of fire reaches the Ābhāsvara Heaven and stops there. The catastrophe of water reaches the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven, and stops there. The catastrophe of wind reaches the Bṛhatphala Heaven and stops there.</p>
<h3>The Catastrophe of Fire</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc614'>SC 614</a>“What is the catastrophe of fire? When the catastrophe of fire is about to happen, the world’s people all practice the correct Dharma. They have right view, aren’t deluded, and cultivate the ten good deeds. When they practice these things, the people attain the second dhyāna, and they leap up into the sky. Those people on the noble path, the heavenly path, and the Brahma path call out from above: ‘Good people, you should know the happiness of the second dhyāna without perception or examination! The second dhyāna is happiness!’</p>
<p>“When the world’s people hear this call, they look up and say to them, ‘Excellent, excellent! Please explain for us the path of the second dhyāna that has no perception or examination!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc615'>SC 615</a>“When the people in the sky hear that, they explain to them the way of the second dhyāna without perception or examination. When the world’s people hear that explanation, they cultivate the path of the second dhyāna without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc616'>SC 616</a>“When sentient beings’ punishment in hell is finished and their lives there end, they’re reborn among humans. They too cultivate the second dhyāna that’s without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end. Sentient beings born as animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … four god kings … Trāyastriṃśa gods … Yama gods … Tuṣita gods … Nirmāṇarati gods … Paranirmitavaśavartin gods … Brahma gods are reborn among humans when their lives end. They too cultivate the second dhyāna that’s without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc617'>SC 617</a>“As a result of these causes, the destiny of hell is ended … animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … Brahma heavens is ended.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc618'>SC 618</a>“As this happens, hell disappears first, and then animal births disappear after it. After animal births are gone, the hungry ghosts disappear. After the hungry ghosts are gone, the asuras disappear. After the asuras are gone, the four god kings disappear. After the four god kings are gone, the Trāyastriṃśa gods disappear. After the Trāyastriṃśa gods are gone, the Yama gods disappear. After the Yama gods are gone, the Tuṣita gods disappear. After the Tuṣita gods are gone, the Nirmāṇarati gods disappear. After the Nirmāṇarati gods are gone, the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods disappear. After the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods are gone, the Brahma gods disappear. After the Brahma gods are gone, then humans disappear with none remaining. After humans are gone with none remaining, the world is destroyed when the catastrophe takes place. Afterward, no rain falls from the heavens, and the hundred grains, grasses, and trees naturally wither and die.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc619'>SC 619</a>The Buddha told the monks, “You should know from this that all formed things are impermanent. They are liable to change and disintegrate, which makes them unreliable. Conditioned things are quite troublesome. You should seek the path of freedom that transcends the world.</p>
<h3>The Seven Suns</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc620'>SC 620</a>“A long, long time after that, a great, dark gale rises. It blows the ocean’s water, which is 84,000 yojanas deep. The wind then divides into two. They grab the palace of the sun and place it halfway up Mount Sumeru, which is 42,000 yojanas away from the earth in the orbit of the sun. As a result of this, the world then has two suns that rise. When two suns rise, all the small rivers, streams, and brooks in the world dry up.”</p>

As a result of this, the world then has three suns that rise. When three suns rise, large rivers such as the Gaṅgā River, Jamunā River, Baraṇa River Aciravatī River, Mahī (?)

As a result of this, the world then has four suns that rise. When four suns rise, the springs, deep lakes, Lake Sudarśana, Lake Anavatapta, and the great lakes in all four directions, utpala lakes, kumuda lakes, puṇḍarīka lakes, and lakes that are fifty yojanas across all dry up completely.</p>

As a result of this, the world then has six suns that rise.

A great wind rises on all four sides of that water, which is called Saṅgha. It blows on the water and agitates it. The crashing of the waves is immense, and a mass of foam accumulates. The wind blows it off of the water and into the sky. It spontaneously hardens there, forming a heavenly palace decorated with the seven treasures.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc676'>SC 676</a>“There are three circumstances for the ocean’s saltiness. What are the three? First, a spontaneous cloud covers the entire sky up to the Ābhāsvara Heaven and releases its rain everywhere. It washes over the heavenly palaces and the world. The Brahmakāyika Heaven’s palace, Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven’s palace … Yama Heaven’s palace, the four continents, 80,000 islands, mountains, great mountains, and Sumeru the mountain king are washed and cleansed. In those places, the pollutants and impure substances are bitter and salty. They flow down into the ocean and combine into a single flavor. Therefore, the ocean’s water is salty.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc677'>SC 677</a>“Second, a great sage in the past cast a spell on the ocean that made it grow salty and bitter so that people couldn’t drink it. Therefore, it’s salty and bitter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc678'>SC 678</a>“Third, that ocean’s water is home to a variety of sentient beings, and their bodies grow large. Some are a hundred yojanas … two hundred yojanas … seven hundred yojanas in size. They spit, drool, urinate, and defecate in the water. Therefore, the ocean’s water is salty.</p>

<h3>The Catastrophe of Water</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc680'>SC 680</a>The Buddha told the monks, “What is the catastrophe of water? When the catastrophe of water happens, the world’s people uphold the correct Dharma, have right view, don’t have wrong views, and cultivate the ten good deeds. After they cultivate the ten good deeds, there are people who attain the third dhyāna that’s without joy and leap up into the sky. Those people on the noble path, the heavenly path, and the path of Brahma call out from above: ‘Good people, you should know the happiness of the third dhyāna without joy! The third dhyāna that’s without joy is happiness!’</p>
<p>“When the world’s people hear this call, they look up and say to them, ‘Excellent, excellent! Please explain for us the path of the third dhyāna that’s without joy!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc681'>SC 681</a>“When the people in the sky hear that, they explain the path of the third dhyāna that’s without joy. When the world’s people hear that explanation, they cultivate the path of the third dhyāna, and they’re born in the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc682'>SC 682</a>“When sentient beings’ punishment in hell is finished and their lives end, they’re reborn among humans. They too cultivate the path of the third dhyāna, and they’re born in the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end. Sentient beings born as animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … four god kings … Trāyastriṃśa gods … Yama gods … Tuṣita gods … Nirmāṇarati gods … Paranirmitavaśavartin gods … Brahma gods … Ābhāsvara gods are reborn as humans when their lives end. They too cultivate the path of the third dhyāna, and they’re born in the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc683'>SC 683</a>“As a result of these causes, the destiny of hell is ended … animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … the four god kings … Ābhāsvara Heaven is ended.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc684'>SC 684</a>“As this happens, hell disappears first, and then animal births disappear after it. After animal births are gone, the hungry ghosts disappear. After the hungry ghosts are gone, the asuras disappear. After the asuras are gone, the four god kings disappear. After the four god kings are gone, the Trāyastriṃśa gods disappear. After the Trāyastriṃśa gods are gone, the Yama gods disappear. After the Yama gods are gone, the Tuṣita gods disappear. After the Tuṣita gods are gone, the Nirmāṇarati gods disappear. After the Nirmāṇarati gods are gone, the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods disappear. After the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods are gone, the Brahma gods disappear. After the Brahma gods are gone, then the Ābhāsvara gods disappear. After the Ābhāsvara gods are gone, then humans disappear with none remaining. After humans are gone with none remaining, the world is destroyed when the catastrophe takes place.”</p>

A great wind rises on all four sides of that water, which is called Saṅgha. It blows on the water and agitates it. The crashing of the waves is immense, and a mass of foam accumulates. The wind blows it off of the water and into the sky. It spontaneously hardens there, forming the Ābhāsvara Heaven’s palace, which is decorated with the seven treasures.
