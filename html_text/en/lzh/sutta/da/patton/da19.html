  <h1>The Great Congregation</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Kapilavastu in the country of the Śākyans. He was accompanied by a large assembly of five hundred monks, all of whom were arhats. Marvelous gods had also gathered from the ten directions to honor the Tathāgata and the saṅgha of monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that four Śuddhâvāsa gods up in heaven each thought to themselves, “Today, the Bhagavān is staying at Kapilavastu in the country of the Śākyans. He’s accompanied by a large assembly of five hundred monks, all of whom are arhats. Marvelous gods have also gathered from the ten directions to honor the Tathāgata and the saṅgha of monks. Now, let’s go visit the Bhagavān as well. We’ll each praise the Tathāgata with a verse.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Those four Śuddhâvāsa gods then disappeared from their heaven and arrived at Kapilavastu of the Śākyans in the time it takes a strong man to flex his arm. Once they had arrived, those four Śuddhâvāsa gods bowed their heads at the Buddha’s feet and stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The first Śuddhâvāsa god went before the Buddha and praised him with this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Today, a great congregation<br>
Of gods and spirits has gathered.<br>
They’ve come for the Dharma<br>
And to bow to the supreme assembly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>After speaking this verse, that god withdrew and stood to one side. Another Śuddhâvāsa god then composed a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Monks see the many defilements;<br>
Their upright minds guard against them.<br>
Desire is like the sea swallowing rivers;<br>
The wise guard their faculties against it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Having spoken this verse, that god withdrew and stood to one side. Another Śuddhâvāsa god then composed a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Remove thorns, level craving’s chasm,<br>
And fill the trench of ignorance.<br>
Trek alone to the site of purity<br>
Like excellent, well-trained elephants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Having spoken this verse, that god withdrew and stood to one side. Another Śuddhâvāsa god composed a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Taking refuge in the Buddha,<br>
One never falls to a bad destiny.<br>
They abandon their human forms<br>
And receive the pure bodies of gods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>After those four Śuddhâvāsa gods had presented these verses, the Bhagavān approved of them. They bowed at the Buddha’s feet, circled him three times, and suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Not long after they left, the Buddha told the monks, “There’s a great congregation of gods today! There’s a great gathering of gods today! Marvelous gods from the ten directions have come to honor and look upon the Tathāgata and saṅgha of monks. Monks, the Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Completely Awakened Ones of the past also had great congregations of gods, just as I do today. The Tathāgatas, Arhats, and Completely Awakened Ones in the future will have great congregations of gods, just as I do today.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Monks, this great congregation of gods today consists of spirits and sublime gods from the ten directions who’ve come to honor and look upon the Tathāgata and saṅgha of monks. They also praise their names in verses that they speak for you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Monks, you should know:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Living in the Earth’s mountains and valleys,<br>
They hide when they see terrible things.<br>
Those wearing all white clothes<br>
Are pure and immaculate.<br>
When the gods and people hear this,<br>
They take refuge in the god Brahmā.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Now, I will praise their names<br>
In order, without any missing.<br>
This assembly of gods has come today;<br>
You monks should know them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“All the worldly people’s knowledge<br>
Doesn’t see a hundredth of them.<br>
How then could they see<br>
The assembly of 70,000 demon spirits?<br>
If they saw 100,000 demons,<br>
They haven’t seen all of them on one side.<br>
How could they see the demon spirits<br>
That are everywhere under heaven?</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Among the earth spirits, there are 7,000 yakṣas of various kinds that possess miraculous powers, appearances, forms, and names. With delighted thoughts, they’ve come to the assembly of monks in this grove.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“These four god kings are the protectors of the world and possess great majestic virtue. Their bodies shine as they come to visit Kapilavastu.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>The Bhagavān then wanted to vanquish their illusory and deluded thoughts, so he composed this incantation: “Deceptive (māyā) is <span class='add'>[Kiṭi]</span>; deceptive is <span class='add'>[Kiṭi]</span>! <span class='add'>[So is Vikiṭi; so is Vikiṭi]</span>!

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>The Bhagavān then created another incantation:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Then, the nāga Nāgasā came from Vaiśāla with Takṣaka.<br>
The Yamunā dhṛtarāṣṭras came, as did <span class='add'>[Tiva]</span> with their kin.<br>

The great nāga Airāvaṇa and the nāga <span class='add'>[Vima]</span> have come.<br>
“Of the clear-eyed heavenly birds that hunt the nāga kings,<br>
The colorful Suparṇa came to the grove from the sky.<br>
The nāga kings are unafraid, for the Buddha <span class='add'>[makes them safe from Suparṇa]</span>.<br>
Greeting them with gentle words, Suparṇa took refuge in the Buddha.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>The Bhagavān then created an incantation for the asuras:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Defeated by Vajrahastena, the asuras fled to the ocean;<br>
Vāsavassi frightened them with his great miraculous power.<br>
The asuras were Kālakañja, Mahābhīmṣa, <span class='add'>[Dānaveghasā]</span>,<br>
Vemacitra, Sucitra, Prahlāda, Mucilinda, and <span class='add'>[Nava]</span>.<br>

‘Now is the time, sir. The monks have gathered in a grove.’”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>The Bhagavān again created an incantation for the gods:</p>

Varuṇā, goddesses Vāruṇī, Soma, and Yaśas have come.<br>
Maitrā and Varuṇā’s host of gods with great miraculous power have come.<br>
These ten groups of gods have a variety of colors.<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>There was then another 1,000 five-powered priests for whom the Tathāgata also compiled an incantation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>The first Brahma king of this world and the gods of the Brahma heavens possessed miraculous abilities. There was a Brahma prince named Tiṣya who possessed great miraculous power.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>There was also the other Brahma kings of the ten directions, each of whom was surrounded by their followers as they came. There was a great Brahma king from beyond 1,000 worlds who saw the great congregations of the Bhagavān. He came quickly with his followers surrounding him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>King Māra saw the great congregation around the Bhagavān and had a cruel thought. He thought to himself, “I’ll lead an army of demons to go and destroy that entire congregation. I won’t let any of them escape!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>He then commanded his fourfold army to beat their chariots with their hands, which sounded like crashing thunder. None who saw them weren’t frightened by it. He sent a great storm of wind, rain, lightning, and thunder at that great congregation that surrounded Kapila Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>The Buddha addressed the monks who were delighted with this assembly: “You should know that today Māra’s host is coming with evil intent!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>He then said in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Now, you should be respectful<br>
And establish the Buddha’s Dharma.<br>
You must destroy this host of Māra<br>
Like elephants trampling flowers and grass.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Focus your attention without carelessness<br>
And perfect the pure precepts.<br>
Still your minds, think naturally,<br>
And guard your intentions well.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>If in the correct teaching<br>
You can not be careless,<br>
You’ll be freed from old age and death<br>
And forever end the source of suffering.</p>

They diligently make effort.<br>
Transcending the myriad desires,<br>
Not a single hair of theirs is disturbed.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>This assembly is the greatest;<br>
It possesses great knowledge and renown.<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>The gods, spirits, yakṣas, and sages of five powers who surrounded the Buddha saw what Māra was doing and were shocked like never before. When the Buddha taught this Dharma, 84,000 gods became removed from dust and free of defilement, and their vision of the Dharma was purified.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>The gods, nāgas, yakṣas, spirits, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnara, mahoragas, humans, and non-humans who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
