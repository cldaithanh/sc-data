<h2>Chapter 4: The Hells</h2>
<h3>The Eight Great Hells</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc200'>SC 200</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are 8,000 islands that surround the four continents. There’s also a great ocean that completely encircles those 8,000 islands, and a chain of great diamond mountains encircles that ocean. Beyond those diamond mountains, there’s a second chain of great diamond mountains. There’s an utter darkness between those two mountain chains, where the great illuminating power of the sun and moon gods doesn’t reach.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc201'>SC 201</a>“There are eight great hells there, and each of those hells has sixteen lesser hells. The first great hell is called *Saṃjñā. The second is called Kālasūtra. The third is called *Saṃhata. The fourth is called *Roravaṇa. The fifth is called *Mahāroravaṇa. The sixth is called Tapana. The seventh is called Mahātapana. The eighth is called Avīci.</p>
<h3>The Great Hell of *Saṃjñā</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc202'>SC 202</a>“The *Saṃjñā Hell has sixteen lesser hells. These lesser hells are 500 yojanas across. The first lesser hell is called Black Sand. The second is called Boiling Excrement. The third is called Five Hundred Nails. The fourth is called Hunger. The fifth is called Thirst. The sixth is called Copper Cauldron. The seventh is called Many Copper Cauldrons. The eighth is called Grinding Stone. The ninth is called Pus and Blood. The tenth is called Measuring Fire. The eleventh is called River of Ash. The twelfth is called Iron Ball. The thirteenth is called Axes. The fourteenth is called Wolves. The fifteenth is called Sword Trees. The sixteenth is called Frozen Ice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc203'>SC 203</a>“What is called the *Saṃjñā Hell? In that hell, sentient beings grow iron claws on their hands that are long and sharp. They are quick to anger, harboring resentments and harmful notions. When they seize each other with their claws, flesh falls from their hands. After they perceive their own deaths, a cool breeze blows over them and restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and perceive of themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these perceptions, it’s called the *Saṃjñā Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc204'>SC 204</a>“Furthermore, the sentient beings in the *Saṃjñā Hell harbor harmful notions and attack each other. They hold spontaneous swords in their hands, and those swords have sharp points. They hack and stab each other, slicing and chopping their bodies to bits on the ground. They perceive, ‘I’m dead,’ and then a cool breeze blows over them that restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and perceive of themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these circumstances, it’s called the *Saṃjñā Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc205'>SC 205</a>“Furthermore, the sentient beings in the *Saṃjñā Hell harbor harmful notions and attack each other. Holding swords in their hands that have sharp points, they chop and stab each other, slicing and cutting until they perceive, ‘I’m dead.’ A cool breeze blows over them that restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and say to themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these circumstances, it’s called the *Saṃjñā Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc206'>SC 206</a>“Furthermore, the sentient beings in that *Saṃjñā Hell harbor harmful notions and attack each other. Holding oiled dark blades in their hands that have sharp points, they chop and stab each other, slicing and cutting until they perceive, ‘I’m dead.’ A cool breeze blows over them that restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and say to themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ The other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these circumstances, it’s called the *Saṃjñā Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc207'>SC 207</a>“Furthermore, the sentient beings in that *Saṃjñā Hell harbor harmful perceptions and attack each other. Holding small swords in their hands that have sharp points, they chop and stab each other, slicing and cutting until they perceive, ‘I’m dead.’ A cool breeze blows over them that restores their skin and flesh. Quickly healed, they stand back up and say to themselves, ‘I’m alive again!’ Other sentient beings say, ‘I perceive that you are alive!’ Because of these circumstances, it’s called the *Saṃjñā Hell.</p>
<h3>The Lesser Hell of Black Sand</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc208'>SC 208</a>“After experiencing this punishment for a long time, those sentient beings escape the *Saṃjñā Hell. They run in confusion, trying to save themselves from the prison of their past misdeeds, but they inadvertently arrive at the Black Sand Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc209'>SC 209</a>“A fierce and hot wind rises there that blows hot black sand. It sticks to the sentient beings and makes their whole bodies black as a dark cloud. That hot sand also burns their skin and all their flesh down to their bones. A black torch arises from those sinners, and it circles round and round them before returning to their bodies. This makes them to suffer as they’re burnt to a crisp. They experience these pains because of their misdeeds, but their punishment isn’t done yet, so they’re prevented from dying.</p>
<h3>The Lesser Hell of Boiling Excrement</h3>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc211'>SC 211</a>“That hell is spontaneously filled with boiling excrement and iron balls. The sinners are forced to embrace the iron balls, which burn their bodies and hands up to their heads. No part of them isn’t covered by it. They’re made to feel around, pick it up, and put it into their mouths, which burns their tongue and gums. From their throat, it continues to their stomach and passes down through them. No part of them isn’t burned by it. There are iron fanged serpents that bite them, too. They eat their skin and flesh down to their bones and into their marrow. The pain is bitter and extreme, and their sorrow is measureless. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die.</p>
<h3>The Lesser Hell of Iron Nails</h3>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc213'>SC 213</a>“Upon arriving, they fall into that hell and land on burning iron, which is then wrapped around their body. Their hands, feet, and heart are nailed all around with a total of 500 iron spikes. The pain is bitter and extreme, and they cry out and wail. Their punishment is not done yet, so they still don’t die.</p>
<h3>The Lesser Hell of Hunger</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc214'>SC 214</a>“After experiencing these pains for a long time, they escape the Iron Nails Hell.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc215'>SC 215</a>“The wardens come and ask the sinner, ‘What were you searching for when you came here?’</p>
<p>“They reply, ‘I’m hungry!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc216'>SC 216</a>“The wardens then grab them and wrap their body in hot iron. They then force their mouth open with iron forceps and put a hot iron ball into it. It burns their gums and tongue. From their throat to their stomach, the iron ball passes down through them. No part of them isn’t burned to a crisp. The pain is bitter and extreme, and they cry and wail. Their punishment is not done yet, so they still don’t die.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc221'>SC 221</a>“The wardens there glare angrily at the sinner, grab them by their feet, and put them into the cauldron headfirst. They’re stirred in boiling water, flowing up, down, and all around. They might go from the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom, or stay in the belly of the cauldron as their body cooks. They’re like beans being stirred in boiling water, flowing up, down, and all around. Once they are thoroughly cooked, they disintegrate. The sinner in that cauldron goes up and down as they are boiled in the same way. They cry out and wail, being subjected to a multitude of pains. Their punishment isn’t done yet, so they still don’t die.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc224'>SC 224</a>“Sometimes a hand or foot appears in the cauldron, a thigh or belly appears, or a head or face appears.

The ashen water is boiling hot, the noxious air is fiery and smoky, swirling waves crash into each other, and the echoing noise is terrible. From bottom to top, horizontal eight-inch iron thorns stab the sinner. Long swords grow on the river’s shores. There are also wardens and wolves on its shores. Beyond the shores, sword trees grow that have eight-inch blades for limbs, leaves, flowers, and fruit that have sharp points.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc233'>SC 233</a>“In the river, the sinner is pushed up and down by the waves, swirling around and being submerged.

They use an iron cord to mark them with straight lines, then they use hot iron axes to chop along the lines that were marked on the sinner until they are reduced to a hundred thousand slices. Like a carpenter using a cord to mark wood and then chopping along the lines with a sharp axe to make a hundred thousand slices, they handle the sinner in the same way.

<h3>The Great Vajra Mountains Protect the World</h3>

They might well soar fifty kilometers into the sky, and they would all be reduced to dust. Like a handful of fine chaff thrown into the air by a strong man, that great wind would likewise blow the Earth away. Those two great diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.</p>

If that wind were to reach the four continents, the sentient beings, mountains, streams, rivers, seas, plants, trees, and forests there would be scorched and wither. As when moisture leaves the plants during the height of summer and they quickly turn brown and wither, that wind would be the same. If it reached this world, the hot air would bake it in the same way. Those two diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming.

Twenty lifetimes in the *Ahaha Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Why Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Why Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Sheep Bleating Hell.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc321'>SC 321</a>“A great warden of hell then grabs King Yama and lays him down on hot iron. The warden forces his mouth open with iron forceps and pours molten copper into it. It burns his gums and tongue. From his throat to his stomach, it burns down through him. No part of him isn’t burned to a crisp. After this punishment is done, he rejoins his maidens, and they entertain each other. His great ministers likewise receive the same fortunes.”</p>
<h3>The Three Heavenly Messengers</h3>

When their bodies break up and their lives end, they fall to Hell.</p>

That hell’s walls are made of iron,<br>
And iron nets cover it.</p>

<p>The ground beneath it is iron<br>
That spontaneously bursts in flames.<br>
It’s a hundred yojanas across,<br>
Standing firm and immovable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Black smoke rises from bright fires,<br>
Burning red, they’re hard to look at.<br>
With sixteen lesser hells,<br>
Its fires blaze as a result of doing evil.”</p>

<h3>King Yama Wishes for Liberation</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc341'>SC 341</a>The Buddha told the monks, “King Yama then had this thought occur to him, ‘The world’s sentient beings are deluded and unaware. Their physical conduct is bad, and their verbal and mental conduct is bad. After their lives end, few of them won’t experience this suffering. If the world’s sentient beings could mend their evil ways and cultivate good physical, verbal, and mental conduct, they would experience happiness when their lives end as gods and spirits.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc342'>SC 342</a>“If I’m born among humans after my life ends, perhaps I’ll encounter a Tathāgata. I’ll cut off my hair and beard and put on the three Dharma robes in the correct teaching. I’ll leave home and cultivate the path. I’ll cultivate the pure religious life with pure faith. Having accomplished the task, I’ll put an end to birth and death. I’ll realize for myself in the present life that I won’t be subject to another existence.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc343'>SC 343</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Though they see heaven’s messengers,<br>
Still, they are careless.<br>
Such people always feel sorrow<br>
And are born in despicable places.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>If they’re wise people<br>
Who see the heavenly messengers,<br>
They stay close to the noble teaching<br>
And don’t act carelessly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Seeing and knowing it, they feel fearful<br>
Of birth, old age, illness, and death.<br>
Not experiencing those things is liberation,<br>
The end of birth, old age, illness, and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>They find the place of safety<br>
And attain the unconditioned in the present.<br>
Having forded sorrows and fears,<br>
They are certain to parinirvāṇa.”</p>
