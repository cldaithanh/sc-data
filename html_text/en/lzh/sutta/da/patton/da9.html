  <h1>The Gathered Saṅgha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was travelling among the Mallas. Accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks, he eventually arrived at Cunda’s Mango Grove of Pāpā.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was the fifteenth-day full moon when the Bhagavān sat in an open area with the assembly of monks both in front and behind him. After he had given them many discourses on the Dharma that evening, the Bhagavān addressed Śāriputra, “The monks have gathered today from the four directions to diligently apply themselves together. They aren’t sleepy yet, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’d like to take a break for a while. Perhaps you can explain the Dharma for the monks now?”</p>
<p>Śāriputra replied, “Very well. I’ll explain the noble teaching.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān folded his outer robe four times and laid on his right side like a lion with his feet together.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Śāriputra then told the monks, “Now, here in this city of Pāpā, it hasn’t been long since Nirgrantha Jñātaputra’s life ended. Since then, his disciples have split into two factions that constantly argue and look for shortcomings to reproach each other. They contradict each other, saying: ‘I know this teaching.’ ‘You don’t know this.’ ‘You hold wrong views.’ ‘I hold to the right teaching.’ Their words are confused and without proper order. They consider statements praising themselves to be true, saying: ‘My statement is the winner; your words are defeated. I’m the one who gives discourses now. Come and ask me when you have questions.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, the people of the country who make offerings to the Nirgranthas are weary and troubled by the noise of their fighting. As a result, they consider their teaching to be untrue. A teaching that’s untrue has no way to escape, just as a ruined shrine cannot be repainted. It’s not the teaching of a completely awakened one. Monks, only we Śākyans have the unsurpassed, noble teaching that’s truest and can lead to the escape, just as a newly built shrine is easily decorated. It’s the teaching of a completely awakened one.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monks, today, we ought to collect the Dharma and Vinaya to safeguard them from disputes, establish the religious life for a long time, and benefit many people so that gods and humans will obtain peace.</p>
