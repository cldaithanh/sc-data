<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying in Aṅga accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks. They traveled among the people, stopping to stay at the city of Campā by the side of Gargā Pond.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, there was a priest named Śroṇatāṇḍya who was residing in Campā, a city that was populous, thriving, and bountiful. King Prasenajit had bestowed the city to the priest Śroṇatāṇḍya as his priestly due.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>This priest was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span>, so he wasn’t slighted by others. He had mastered the three Vedas and could discern all the various kinds of scriptures. He was learned about all the subtleties of the world’s scriptures. He was also skilled in the techniques of <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. He had 500 disciples whom he taught without exception.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The priests, prominent people, and householders in Campā heard: “The ascetic Gautama of the Śākya clan, who had left the home life <span class='add'>[113a]</span> and achieved awakening, is touring among the people of Aṅga and has arrived by the side of Gargā Pond. He possesses a great reputation that’s heard throughout the world. He’s a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets. Among gods, worldly men, and demons, whether they’re in the assemblies of Māra, gods, ascetics, or priests, he is self-realized and teaches the Dharma for others. His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>They said, “It would be fitting to go and have an audience with such a realized man as this. We should go and pay him a visit now!” After they said that, they followed each other as they left the city. Crowds of people headed out to visit the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The priest Śroṇatāṇḍya was up in his tower and saw those crowds of people from a distance. He asked his attendant, “What’s the reason those crowds of people are following each other? Where are they going?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>His attendant said, “I heard this: ‘The ascetic Gautama of the Śākya clan, who had left the home life and achieved awakening, is touring among the people of Aṅga and has arrived by the side of Gargā Pond. He possesses a great reputation that’s heard throughout the world. He’s a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets.

His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life.’ Those crowds of priests, prominent people, and householders of Campā are going to pay a visit to the ascetic Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>The priest Śroṇatāṇḍya then instructed his attendant: “Quickly, memorize my words and go tell those people this: ‘All of you, wait a little while for me. We’ll go pay a visit to that Gautama together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>His attendant then went and told those people Śroṇatāṇḍya’s message: ‘Everyone, wait a little while for me. We’ll go pay a visit to that Gautama together.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The people replied to his attendant, “Quickly return to the priest and tell him, ‘Now is a good time. We should go together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The attendant returned and said, “The people are waiting. They say, ‘Now is a good time. We should go together.’” The priest Śroṇatāṇḍya then came down from his tower and stood at its entrance.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>At the time, another five hundred priests had already first assembled under the entrance for some minor reason. When they saw the priest Śroṇatāṇḍya coming, they all looked up and asked, “Great priest, where are you going?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya replied, “The ascetic Gautama of the Śākya clan, who had left the home life and achieved awakening, is touring among the people of Aṅga and has arrived by the side of Gargā Pond.

It would be fitting to go and have an audience with such a true man as this. I’m going to visit him and have a look at his <span class='add'>[bodily]</span> signs.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>Those five hundred priests said to Śroṇatāṇḍya, “Don’t go and look at his signs. Why not? He should visit you here; you shouldn’t go there to visit him. Now, great priest, you’re descended from fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span> for seven generations, and other people don’t slight you.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Moreover, great priest, students come from the four directions to request <span class='add'>[your instruction]</span>, asking about the technique of sacrifices and rituals.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya then told the priests, “So it is, so it is! As you’ve said, I’m endowed with these virtues; there are none I don’t possess. Now, listen to what I say: These virtues are possessed by the ascetic Gautama, so we should go there to him; he shouldn’t come here to us.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a>Those five hundred priests then said to Śroṇatāṇḍya, “Amazing! Extraordinary! Does he have such virtues? If he were to achieve just one of these virtues, he still shouldn’t come <span class='add'>[here to us]</span>. How would it be if he were endowed with all of them? It would be fitting for us to come along and greet him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya replied, “If you want to go, it’s a good time to do so.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya then prepared horses and a treasure chariot, and he went to Gargā Pond surrounded by those five hundred priests and the priests, prominent people, and householders of Campā. He stopped not far from the pond and thought to himself, “Suppose I question Gautama, and maybe it’s not to his liking? That ascetic Gautama will rebuke me, ‘You should ask this question and not ask that question.’ The crowd will overhear him and take me for a fool, and my reputation will be damaged. Suppose the ascetic Gautama asks me about a topic, and maybe my answer won’t be to his liking. That ascetic Gautama will rebuke me, ‘You should answer this way and not that way.’ The crowd will overhear him and take me for a fool, and my reputation will be damaged. Suppose I remain silent. When I return, the people will say, ‘This priest knows nothing!’ No matter what I do, visiting the ascetic Gautama will damage my reputation. If the ascetic Gautama asked me about the priest’s teaching, that would be the only topic I could answer well enough to suit him!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>Once he finished thinking that beside of Gargā Pond, Śroṇatāṇḍya dismounted from his chariot and walked on foot to the Bhagavān. After they had exchanged greetings, he sat down to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>Some of the priests, prominent people, and householders of Campā bowed to the Buddha and sat. Some of them exchanged greetings with him and sat. Some of them praised him and sat. Some of their saluted him with their hands together and sat. Some remained quiet and sat. When the crowd was seated and settled, the Buddha knew that thought the priest Śroṇatāṇḍya had in his mind, so he told him, “Regarding that thought you had, you should do as you wish.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>The Buddha then asked Śroṇatāṇḍya, “How many qualities of a priest have you accomplished? Be honest; don’t speak falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya then silently thought to himself, “Amazing! Extraordinary! The ascetic Gautama has that great miraculous power to read people’s minds. He asked about the topic that I had thought about!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>The priest Śroṇatāṇḍya sat up straight, surveyed the audience around them, and smiled happily. He then answered the Buddha, “I’ve accomplished five qualities of a priest, speaking honestly and not falsely. What are the five? One is that I’m a priest who is descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who are genuine so that other people don’t slight me. Two is that I’ve mastered and chant the three Vedas, discern all the various scriptures, and I’m learned about all the subtleties of the world’s scriptures. I’m also skilled at <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. Three is that I’m handsome looking. Four is that I’ve perfected the observance of precepts. Five is that I’m wise and insightful. These are the five. Gautama, I’ve accomplished these five qualities of a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>The Buddha said, “Good, Śroṇatāṇḍya! Could it be that a priest who discards one of those five qualities and achieves four of them could also be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya said to the Buddha, “He could. Why is that? Gautama, what purpose does his birth serve? Suppose a priest masters and chants the three Vedas, discerns all the various scriptures, and he’s learned about all the subtleties of the world’s scriptures. He’s also skilled at <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. He’s handsome looking. He perfects the observance of precepts, and he’s wise and insightful. Having these four qualities, he could be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>The Buddha told Śroṇatāṇḍya, “Good, good! If he were to lack one of those four qualities and achieve three of them, would he still be called a priest, speak truthfully and not falsely?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc63'>SC 63</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya replied, “He would. Why is that? What purpose does his birth and the Vedas serve? Suppose a priest is handsome looking, has perfected the observance of precepts, and is wise and insightful. Achieving these three qualities, he could be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc64'>SC 64</a>The Buddha said, “Good, good! How is it? If he were to lack one of those three qualities and achieve two of them, would he be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc65'>SC 65</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya answered, “He would. Why is that? What purpose does his birth, the Vedas, and being handsome serve?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc66'>SC 66</a>Each of the five hundred priests then spoke up and said to the priest Śroṇatāṇḍya: “Why do you disrespect <span class='add'>[a priest’s]</span> birth, the Vedas, and being handsome, saying that they serve no purpose?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>The Bhagavān then told the five hundred priests, “If this priest Śroṇatāṇḍya were ugly, lacked <span class='add'>[a respectable]</span> caste and clan, hadn’t mastered the Vedas, and lacked eloquence, wisdom, and good answers, he wouldn’t be the one speaking with me, and you could speak. Since the priest Śroṇatāṇḍya is handsome, perfect in caste and clan, has mastered the Vedas, and is wise, eloquent, and good at answering questions, he’s qualified to have a discussion with me. The rest of you, remain silent and let this man speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc68'>SC 68</a>The priest Śroṇatāṇḍya then said to the Buddha, “Please, Gautama, stop for a moment. I’ll instruct them about the teaching.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc69'>SC 69</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya then told the five hundred priests, “Now, don’t you see my nephew who’s a student here in this assembly? Of everyone assembled here, only Gautama’s appearance is as handsome as his, but that student does evil things like killing, stealing, engaging in sex, lacking courtesy, lying, deceiving, burning people with fire, and cutting them off from the path. Priests, this student from Aṅga has done all these evil things, so what purpose do the Vedas and being handsome serve in the end?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc70'>SC 70</a>The five hundred priests remained silent and didn’t respond. Śroṇatāṇḍya then said to the Buddha, “If he perfects the observance of precepts, and he’s wise and insightful, then he could be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc71'>SC 71</a>The Buddha said, “Good, good! How is it, Śroṇatāṇḍya? If he lacks one of these two qualities and accomplishes one of them, would he be called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc72'>SC 72</a>He answered, “He cannot. Why is that? The precepts are wise, and wisdom is the precepts. Having both precepts and wisdom, then as a result I would say that he is called a priest, speaking truthfully and not falsely.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc73'>SC 73</a>The Buddha said, “Good, good! As you’ve said, having precepts is having wisdom, and having wisdom is having precepts. Precepts purify wisdom, and wisdom purifies precepts. Śroṇatāṇḍya, it’s like when someone washes their hands: The right and left hand need each other. The left hand washes the right hand, and the right hand washes the left hand. These things are likewise. Having wisdom is having precepts, and having precepts is having wisdom. Precepts purify wisdom, and wisdom purifies precepts. Priest, I say someone endowed with precepts and wisdom is called a monk.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc74'>SC 74</a>Śroṇatāṇḍya then said to the Buddha, “What are the precepts?”</p>
<p>The Buddha replied, “Listen closely, listen closely; consider it well! I will discern them one by one for you.”</p>
<p>He responded, “Very well! I’d be glad to hear it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc75'>SC 75</a>The Bhagavān then told Śroṇatāṇḍya, “Suppose a Tathāgata appears in the world who’s Worthy of Alms, Completely Awakened, Accomplished in Insight and Conduct, Well Gone, Understands the World, an Unsurpassed Man, Trainer of Men, Teacher to Gods and Humans, a Buddha, and a Bhagavān. Among gods, worldly people, ascetics, and priests, he’s self-realized, and he teaches for others. His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc76'>SC 76</a>“Suppose prominent people or the children of prominent people hear this teaching. Once their belief is pure, they thus observe: ‘The household life is difficult; it’s like being in handcuffs and bond. I’d like to cultivate the religious life, but I can’t free myself from it. I’d rather cut off my hair, put on the three Dharma robes, leave home, and cultivate the path.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc77'>SC 77</a>“At some different time, they renounce their home, property, and occupation, part with family and friends, put on the three Dharma robes, and leave ornaments behind.
