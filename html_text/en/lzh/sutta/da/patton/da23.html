  <h1>Kūṭatāṇḍya</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was in the country of Kośala accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks. Touring among the people, they arrived north of the priest town of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span> in Kośala and stopped to stay in a rosewood grove.</p>
<h3>The Priest Kūṭatāṇḍya</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>There was a priest named Kūṭatāṇḍya who lived in <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span>. The town was bountiful, and the people were flourishing. It had scenic parks, bathing ponds, and refreshing trees. King Prasenajit had granted this town to the priest Kūṭatāṇḍya as his priestly due. This priest was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine, so he wasn’t slighted by others. He had mastered the three Vedas, could discern all the various kinds of scriptures, and was learned about all the subtleties of worldly literature. He was also skilled in the way of the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and ritual sacrifices and etiquette. He had 500 disciples whom he taught without exception.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>That priest was about to arrange a large sacrifice at the time. He had acquired 500 bulls, 500 cows, 500 bull calves, 500 heifer calves, 500 ewes, and 500 wethers to offer as sacrifices.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The priests, prominent men, and householders of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span> heard: “The ascetic Gautama of the Śākyans who left home and achieved awakening has been touring among the people of Kośala. He arrived north of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span> and stopped to stay in the rosewood grove there. His great fame is heard throughout the world: ‘He’s a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets!’ Among gods and worldly people, be they Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, or priests, he teaches for others what he himself has realized. His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life. It’s fitting to have an audience with such a realized person.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>They then said, “We’d better go and pay him a visit now!” After they said that, they followed each other as they left <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span>. Crowds of people headed out to visit the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The priest Kūṭatāṇḍya was up in the upper story of his house and saw the crowds of people following each other from a distance. He asked his attendant, “What’s the reason those crowds of people are following each other? Where are they going?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>His attendant said, “I heard this: ‘The ascetic Gautama of the Śākyans who had left the home life and achieved awakening has been touring among the people of Kośala. He arrived north of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span> and stopped to stay in the rosewood grove there. His great fame is heard throughout the world: “He’s a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets!” Among gods and worldly people, be they Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, or priests, he teaches for others what he himself has realized. His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life.’ Those crowds of priests, prominent people, and householders from the town are going to pay a visit to the ascetic Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>The priest Kūṭatāṇḍya then instructed his attendant: “Quickly, remember what I say. Go tell those people this: ‘Everyone, wait a little while for me. We’ll go pay a visit to that ascetic Gautama together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>His attendant then went and told those people Kūṭatāṇḍya’s message: “‘Everyone, wait a little while for me. We’ll go pay a visit to that Gautama together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The people replied to his attendant, “Quickly, return to the priest and tell him: ‘Now is a good time. We should go together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The attendant returned and said, “The people are waiting. They say: ‘Now is a good time. We should go together.’” The priest Kūṭatāṇḍya then came down from the upper story and stood at his home’s entrance.</p>
<h3>The Priests Object to Visiting the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>At the time, another five hundred priests were already seated outside his door, waiting to help Kūṭatāṇḍya prepare his large sacrifice. When they saw the priest Kūṭatāṇḍya coming, they all rose and greeted him. They said, “Great priest, where are you going?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya replied, “I’ve heard this: ‘The ascetic Gautama of the Śākyans who had left the home life and achieved awakening has been touring among the people of Kośala. He arrived north of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span>, and stopped to stay in the rosewood grove there. His great fame is heard throughout the world: “He’s a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets!” Among gods and worldly people, be they Māras, Brahmās, ascetics, or priests, he teaches for others what he himself has realized. His words are all genuine in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purify the religious life. It’s fitting to have an audience with such a realized person.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Priests, I’ve also heard that Gautama knows the three kinds of ritual sacrifice and sixteen ritual requisites. Now, previous generations and elders in our assembly haven’t known these things, but I want to make a great sacrifice and have prepared the cattle and sheep for it. I’m going to visit Gautama to ask him about the three kinds of ritual sacrifice and sixteen ritual requisites. Once we’ve acquired these ways of ritual sacrifice, we’ll perfect their virtues, and our fame will be heard far and wide.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Those five hundred priests said to Kūṭatāṇḍya, “Don’t go visit him. Why not? He should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him. Now, great priest, you are descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine, so you aren’t slighted by others. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>They continued: “Great priest, you’ve mastered the three Vedas, can discern all the various scriptures, and have learned about the subtleties of worldly literature. You’re also skilled in the way of the great man’s signs, divining fortune and misfortune, and ritual sacrifices and etiquette. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Moreover, great priest, you’re handsome looking, having attained the appearance of Brahmā. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Moreover, great priest, your precepts and virtue are surpassing, and your wisdom is accomplished. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Moreover, great priest, your words are gentle and eloquent, and their content and expression are pure. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Moreover, great priest, scholars come from the four directions with requests <span class='add'>[for instruction]</span>, asking about the techniques of ritual sacrifice. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Moreover, great priest, King Prasenajit and King Bimbisāra respect and support you. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Moreover, great priest, you’re rich, possess treasures, and your treasury is overflowing. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“Moreover, great priest, your wisdom is insightful, your words are learned, and you aren’t timid. You have achieved such status, so he should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“Great teacher, you’ve perfected these eleven qualities. He should come visit you; you shouldn’t go visit him.”</p>
<h3>Kūṭatāṇḍya Explains Why It’s Fitting to Visit the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya then told the priests, “So it is, so it is! As you’ve said, I truly am endowed with these virtues; there are none that I don’t possess.

<h3>Kūṭatāṇḍya Visits the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya then prepared horses and a treasure chariot, and he went to the rosewood grove while surrounded by those five hundred priests as well as the priests, prominent people, and householders of <span class='add'>[Khānumata]</span>. When he arrived, he dismounted from his chariot and proceeded on foot to the Bhagavān. After they had exchanged greetings, he sat to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>Some of the priests, prominent people, and householders bowed to the Buddha and sat down. Some of them exchanged greetings with him and sat down. Some of them told him their name and sat down. Some of them saluted the Buddha with their palms together and sat down. Some of them remained quiet and sat down. Once the assembly was seated and settled, Kūṭatāṇḍya said to the Buddha, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you have a moment and would permit me.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “You may ask your question.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>The priest then said to the Buddha, “I’ve heard that Gautama clearly understands the three types of ritual sacrifice and sixteen kinds of ritual requisites. Our previous generations and elders aren’t able to know them, but now we are going to perform a large sacrifice. I’ve prepared 500 bulls, 500 cows, 500 bull calves, 500 heifer calves, 500 ewes, and 500 wethers to offer as sacrifices. Today, I’ve come to ask about the way of the three ritual sacrifices and sixteen ritual requisites. If we could accomplish this sacrifice, we would obtain a great reward, the fame would be far-reaching, and both gods and people would respect us.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>The Bhagavān then told Kūṭatāṇḍya, “Now, listen closely. Listen closely and consider it well. I’ll explain this for you.”</p>
<p>The priest said, “Of course, Gautama! I’d be glad to listen.”</p>
<h3>The Story of a Past King’s Large Sacrifice</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>The Buddha told Kūṭatāṇḍya, “A long time ago, there was a warrior king from a water-anointed clan who wanted to arrange a large sacrifice. He met with his priestly great minister and told him, ‘I possess a great fortune, and I freely enjoy the five pleasures, but I’m an old man now. My warriors are powerful; none is weak, and the treasury is overflowing. Now, I want to arrange a large sacrifice. Tell me about the way of sacrifices. What will be needed?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc63'>SC 63</a>“His great minister said, ‘So it is, great king! As the king has said, the country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. However, the people harbor many evil thoughts, and they don’t practice the proper way. If a sacrifice is performed at this time, it wouldn’t accomplish the way of sacrifices, just as a thief sent to chase a thief wouldn’t become a messenger.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc64'>SC 64</a>“‘Great king, don’t think, “These are my people. I can attack, kill, rebuke, and stop them.” Those who approach the king should be provided with what they require. Those managing businesses should be provided wealth. Those cultivating farmland should be provided cattle and seed. Putting these things to use, they will each take care of their business. When the king doesn’t oppress the people, the people will be peaceful. They’ll raise their children and be happy together.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc65'>SC 65</a>The Buddha told Kūṭatāṇḍya, “Hearing what the ministers said, the king provided clothes and food to those close to him, wealth to merchants, and cattle and seed to farmers. The people each took care of their business, and they didn’t trouble each other. They raised their children and were happy together.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc66'>SC 66</a>The Buddha said, “The king summoned the ministers again and told them, ‘My country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. I’ve provided for the people so that they want for nothing. They raise their children and are happy together. Now, I want to arrange a large sacrifice. Tell me about the way of sacrifices. What will be needed?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>“The ministers told the king, ‘So it is, so it is! It’s as the king says. The country is fortunate, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. You’ve provided for the people so that they want for nothing. They raise their children and are happy together. If the king wants a sacrifice, he may speak with his palace wives and let them know about it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc68'>SC 68</a>“The king then did as the minister said. He went into the palace and said to his wives, ‘My country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. I possess many treasures. I want to arrange a large sacrifice.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc69'>SC 69</a>“Then the wives said to the king, ‘So it is, so it is! It’s as the king says. The country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasure is overflowing. He possesses many treasures. If he wants to arrange a large sacrifice, now would be the right time for it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc70'>SC 70</a>“The king returned and told the ministers, ‘My country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. I’ve provided for the people so that they want for nothing. They raise their children and are happy together. Now, I want a large sacrifice. I’ve told the palace wives. All of you, tell me what things will be needed for this.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc71'>SC 71</a>“The ministers then said to the king, ‘So it is, so it is! It’s as the king says. He wants to arrange a large sacrifice and has told the palace wives about it, but he hasn’t told the prince, crown prince, great minister, and the officers. The king should tell them.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc72'>SC 72</a>“Hearing what the ministers said, the king then told the princes, crown prince, ministers, and officers, ‘My country is wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. I want to arrange a large sacrifice.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc73'>SC 73</a>“The princes, crown prince, ministers, and officers then said to the king, ‘So it is, so it is! Great king, the country is now wealthy, the army is strong, and the treasury is overflowing. If you want to arrange a sacrifice, now would be the right time for it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc74'>SC 74</a>“The king again told the great minister, ‘My country is wealthy, the army is strong, and I possess many treasures. I’ve talked to my palace wives, the princes, crown prince, and even the officers. Now, I want to arrange a large sacrifice. What will be needed for this?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc75'>SC 75</a>“The ministers said, ‘It’s as the great king says. If he wants to arrange a sacrifice, now would be the right time for it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc76'>SC 76</a>“Hearing them say this, he had a new palace built to the east of the city. Entering that new palace, the king put on a deerskin garment and rubbed incensed ghee onto his body. He also wore deer antlers on his head and had cow dung spread on the ground, which he sat and laid on. His first wife and priestly great minister selected a yellow cow. It was milked once for the king to drink, once for his wife to drink, once for the minister to drink, and once to give to the great assembly. The rest was given to its calf.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc77'>SC 77</a>“The king then accomplished eight things, and his great minister accomplished four things. What were the eight things that the king accomplished? That warrior king was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine, so he wasn’t slighted by others. This was the first thing he had achieved. That king was a handsome-looking member of a warrior tribe. This was the second thing. The virtue of that king’s precepts was higher, and his wisdom was complete.  This was the third thing. That king practiced a variety of skills such as riding elephants, horses, and chariots, swordsmanship, archery, and other martial arts. There was nothing that he didn’t fully know. This was the fourth thing. That king possessed great authority that brought together the lesser kings. There were none who didn’t submit to him. This was the fifth thing. That king was well-spoken.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc100'>SC 100</a>The Buddha told Kūṭatāṇḍya, “The king had some doubts about those sixteen points, but the great minister disclosed these sixteen things to him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc101'>SC 101</a>The Buddha said, “In that new palace, the great minister plainly instructed, benefited, and gladdened the king by performing ten things. What were the ten? The great minister said, ‘During the king’s ritual sacrifice, there will be a gathering of people who are and aren’t killers. Provide for them all equally. If someone comes who has killed beings, provide for them. The king himself should know, “Should someone come who hasn’t killed beings, I’ll be providing for them, too.” The reason for giving is to think of generosity in this way.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc103'>SC 103</a>The Buddha told the priest, “That great minister instructed him plainly, benefiting and gladdening the king with these ten practices.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc104'>SC 104</a>The Buddha also told the priest, “That warrior king then had three thoughts of regret in his new home, which the great minister dispelled. What were the three? The king had this regret, ‘Now, this is a large sacrifice of mine. My large sacrifices in the past, my large sacrifices in the future, and my large sacrifices in the present have cost much treasure.’ When these three thoughts occurred to him, he felt regret.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc105'>SC 105</a>“The great minister said, ‘The king has made large sacrifices, and his generosity in the past, future, and present has brought the merits of these sacrifices. You shouldn’t feel regretful about it.’ The king went to his new home feeling these three regrets, and the great minister dispelled them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc106'>SC 106</a>The Buddha told the priest, “That water-anointed warrior king left his new home on the fifteenth-day full moon and lit a large bonfire on open ground in front of it. He held up a vessel of oil, poured it into the fire, and called out, ‘I offer this! I offer this!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc107'>SC 107</a>“The king’s wife heard that the king had left his new home on the fifteenth-day full moon, lit a large bonfire in front of it, held up a vessel of oil, poured it on the fire, and called out, ‘I offer this!

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc108'>SC 108</a>“Priest, that king immediately told his wife and concubines, ‘Stop, stop! You have supported it, and my own treasure is great. It’ll be sufficient for the ritual sacrifice.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc109'>SC 109</a>“His wife and concubines then thought to themselves, ‘It wouldn’t be right for us to take these treasures back to the palace. If the king holds a large sacrifice to the east, then we’ll go and contribute to it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc110'>SC 110</a>“Priest, later the king prepared a large sacrifice to the east, and his wife and concubines then provided these treasures to it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc111'>SC 111</a>“The prince and crown prince heard that the king had left the new palace on the fifteenth-day full moon, lit a large bonfire in front of it, held up a vessel of oil, poured it on the fire, and called out, ‘I offer this! I offer this!’ The prince and crown prince brought treasures to the king and told him, ‘These treasures are to help the king conduct his large sacrifice.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc112'>SC 112</a>“The king said, ‘Stop, stop! You have supported it, and my own wealth is great. It’ll be sufficient for the ritual sacrifice.’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc114'>SC 114</a>“Thus, the great minister brought a treasure and said, ‘I wanted to help the king with the ritual sacrifice to the west.’ …</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc116'>SC 116</a>The Buddha told the priest, “When the king held the large sacrifice, he didn’t kill cattle, sheep, or other sentient beings. He only sacrificed butter, milk, sesame oil, honey, black sweets, and rock sweets.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc117'>SC 117</a>The Buddha told the priest, “When that warrior king held the large sacrifice, it was joyous in the beginning, middle, and end. This is the way to accomplish a ritual sacrifice.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc118'>SC 118</a>The Buddha told the priest, “After that warrior king’s large sacrifice, he cut off his hair and beard, put on the three Dharma robes, and left home for the path. He cultivated the four measureless mental states until his body broke up and his life ended, and he was born in the Brahma Heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc119'>SC 119</a>“After she had made her great gift, the king’s wife also cut off her hair, put on the three Dharma robes, and left home to cultivate the path.

After teaching the king the four methods of ritual sacrifice, the priestly great minister also made a great gift. Afterward, he cut off his hair and beard, put on the three Dharma robes, and left home to cultivate the path. He practiced the four Brahma practices until his body broke up and his life ended, and he was born in the Brahma Heaven.”</p>
<h3>The Conversion of Kūṭatāṇḍya</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc120'>SC 120</a>The Buddha told the priest, “The king had followed the three ways of ritual sacrifice, possessed the sixteen ritual requisites, and performed that large sacrifice. What do you think about it?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc121'>SC 121</a>After hearing what the Buddha had said, Kūṭatāṇḍya was silent and didn’t respond. The five hundred priests who were there said to Kūṭatāṇḍya, “The ascetic Gautama’s words are wonderful. Why does the great teacher remain silent and not answer him?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc122'>SC 122</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya replied, “What the ascetic Gautama has taught is wonderful. It’s not that I don’t accept it. The reason I was silent was because I was thinking about it. The ascetic Gautama has explained this subject, but he didn’t say he heard it from someone else, so I was silently thinking, ‘Was the ascetic Gautama that warrior king at the time? Or was he that priestly great minister?’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc123'>SC 123</a>The Bhagavān then told Kūṭatāṇḍya , “Good, good! You’ve examined the Tathāgata and correctly ascertained that he is proper. When that warrior king performed his large sacrifice, was he a different person? Don’t imagine that, for he was myself. That was when I reached the utmost wisdom of great generosity.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc124'>SC 124</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya said to the Buddha, “Precisely these three ways of ritual sacrifice and possession of sixteen ritual requisites obtain a great reward, but is there something else that’s greater?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc125'>SC 125</a>The priest asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “If someone can always provide support to the Saṅgha and doesn’t discontinue it, their virtue is greater than that of the three ways of ritual sacrifice and possession of sixteen ritual requisites.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc126'>SC 126</a>“Is there something else that’s greater than this virtue of always providing support to the Saṅgha and not discontinuing it, which is itself greater than that of the three ways of ritual sacrifice and possession of sixteen ritual requisites?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc127'>SC 127</a>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Erecting monasteries and raised halls for the Saṅgha of the four directions is a gift that’s much greater than that of the three ways of ritual sacrifice and possession of sixteen ritual requisites or supporting the Saṅgha and not discontinuing it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc128'>SC 128</a>“Is there something else that’s greater than this virtue of erecting monasteries and raised halls for the saṃgha in the four directions, which is itself greater than that of the three ways of ritual sacrifice and possession of sixteen ritual requisites or supporting the Saṅgha and not discontinuing it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc129'>SC 129</a>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Suppose someone performs the three ways of ritual sacrifice and possesses sixteen ritual requisites, supports the Saṅgha and doesn’t discontinue it, and they erect monasteries and raised halls for the Saṅgha in the four directions. Those things aren’t equal to producing a joyous mind and declaring, ‘I take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha.’ The merit of this is greater.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc130'>SC 130</a>“Is there something else that’s greater than the reward that’s obtained by these three refuges?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc131'>SC 131</a>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Suppose someone were to accept and practice the five precepts with a joyous heart for their whole life, not killing, stealing, engaging in sex, lying, or drinking alcohol. This merit is greater.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc132'>SC 132</a>“Is there something else that’s greater than the great reward obtained from these three ways of ritual sacrifice … five precepts?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc133'>SC 133</a>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Suppose someone is able to be compassionately mindful of all sentient beings for as long as it takes to pull a squirt of milk from a cow. The merit of that is much greater.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc134'>SC 134</a>“Is there something else that’s greater than the great reward obtained by these three ways of ritual sacrifice … compassion?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “There is.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc135'>SC 135</a>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Suppose a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appears in the world, and someone leaves home to cultivate the path of that Buddha’s teaching. This equips him with a variety of virtues … they perfect the three insights, destroy the darkness of ignorance, and possess the illumination of wisdom. Why is that? The merit of this is much greater because they aren’t negligent and happily dwell in seclusion.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc136'>SC 136</a>Kūṭatāṇḍya again said to the Buddha, “Gautama, I was going to perform a ritual sacrifice that requires five hundred head of cattle and sheep each. Now, I will let them all go so that they can find their own water and grass. I take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha. Permit me to become a layman in the correct teaching. From now on, I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for my whole life. Please let the Bhagavān and the great assembly accept my request!” The Bhagavān silently accepted it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc137'>SC 137</a>The priest then saw that the Buddha had silently accepted his request. He got up, bowed to the Buddha, and circled him three times before leaving. He went home and prepared a variety of delicious foods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc138'>SC 138</a>The next day, the Bhagavān put on his robe and took his bowl. Accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks, he went to the priest’s home where they prepared seats and sat down. The priest then personally served them food, offering it to the Buddha and Saṅgha. When they were finished eating, they left with their bowls. When they were done washing them, the Buddha composed verses for the priest:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Fire is the best of sacrifices;<br>
Poetry is the best for chanting;<br>
The king is the best among people;<br>
The ocean is best among rivers;<br>
The moon is the best among stars;<br>
And the sun is best among lights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Up, down, and in the four directions,<br>
Among all living things that exist,<br>
Whether gods or worldly people,<br>
Only the Buddha is supreme.<br>
Someone looking for great fortune<br>
Should support the three jewels.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Liberation of Kūṭatāṇḍya</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc139'>SC 139</a>The priest Kūṭatāṇḍya then fetched a small chair and sat in front of the Buddha. The Bhagavān gradually taught him the Dharma. He instructed him plainly, benefiting and making him glad. He discoursed on generosity, precepts, birth in heaven, the great danger of desire, the obstacle to going upstream, and the superiority of escape. He discerned and made clear the pure practices. Then, the Bhagavān saw that the priest’s mind had become flexible, his hindrances were reduced, and he was easily trained. He taught him the truth of suffering according to the eternal teaching of Buddhas, discerning and making it clear. He taught the noble truth of formation, the noble truth of cessation, and the noble truth of escape.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc140'>SC 140</a>The priest Kūṭatāṇḍya became far removed from dirt and separated from defilement right where he sat, and he attained purification of the Dharma vision. Like a pristine white muslin that’s easily stained, Kūṭatāṇḍya was likewise. He saw the Dharma and attained the Dharma. Obtaining its fruit, he stood in certainty not because of belief in someone else and attained fearlessness. He said to the Buddha, “Now, I seriously take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and noble Saṅgha three times. Please let the Buddha permit me to become a layman in the correct teaching. From now on, I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for my whole life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc141'>SC 141</a>He also seriously said to the Buddha, “Please let the Bhagavān accept my invitation to stay for seven days.” The Bhagavān silently accepted it. The priest personally served meals to the Buddha and Saṅgha for seven days. After the week had passed, the Buddha continued travelling among the people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc142'>SC 142</a>It wasn’t long after the Buddha departed that Kūṭatāṇḍya became ill, and his life ended.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc143'>SC 143</a>A group of monks heard that Kūṭatāṇḍya had supported the Buddha for seven days and then fell ill and died not long afterward. They thought to themselves, “That man’s life has ended, but where did he go?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc144'>SC 144</a>Those monks went to the Buddha, bowed their heads at his feet, and sat to one side. They asked, “Now that Kūṭatāṇḍya ’s life has ended, where will he be born?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc145'>SC 145</a>The Buddha told the monks, “That man purely cultivated the religious practice and accomplished one state after the next, and he wasn’t disturbed by anything in the teaching. Because he ended the five lower fetters, his Parinirvāṇa was in the present. He didn’t return to this world.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc146'>SC 146</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
