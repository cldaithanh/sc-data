  <h1>Govinda</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa near Rājagṛha. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<h3>Pañcaśikha Visits the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>During the quiet of the night when there are no people, the gandharva Pañcaśikha came to the Buddha, illuminating Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa with his radiance. After bowing his head at the Buddha’s feet, he stood to one side. Pañcaśikha then said to the Buddha, “Yesterday, the king of the Brahma Heaven went to the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven and had a conversation with Lord Śakra. I personally overheard them. Shall I tell the Bhagavān what they said?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “You may tell me if you like.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Pañcaśikha said, “One time, the Trāyastriṃśa gods gathered in the Dharma Meeting Hall and held a meeting. The four god kings were each sitting in their places. God king Dhṛtarāṣṭra sat to the east and faced west with Lord Śakra in front of him. God king Virūḍhaka sat to the south and faced north with Lord Śakra in front of him. God king Virūpākṣa sat to the west and faced east with Lord Śakra in front of him. God king Vaiśravaṇa sat to the north and faced south with Lord Śakra in front of him. The four god kings were seated first, and then I was seated after them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“There were other great gods present who had purely cultivated the religious life with the Buddha. They had been born in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven when their lives ended, which caused the five virtues of those gods to increase. These were 1. the lifespan of gods, 2. the form of gods, 3. the fame of gods, 4. the pleasure of gods, and 5. the majesty of gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods danced and rejoiced, saying, ‘The host of gods increases, and the host of asuras decreases!’ Śakra the Lord of Gods noticed the Trāyastriṃśa gods were rejoicing, so he composed these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“‘The gods of the Trāyastriṃśa<br>
And Lord Śakra are celebrating!<br>
Homage to the Tathāgata,<br>
The king of the highest teaching!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The gods get their shape and fortunes<br>
Of life, form, name, pleasure, and majesty.<br>
They trained in the Buddha’s religious life,<br>
So they’ve been reborn in this place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Again, there are all these gods<br>
With radiant forms so glorious.<br>
The Buddha’s wise disciples<br>
Born here are the most excellent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The Trāyastriṃśa gods and their lord<br>
Consider their own happiness here.<br>
Homage to the Tathāgata,<br>
The king of the highest teaching!’</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Buddha’s Eight Unequalled Qualities</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“After the Trāyastriṃśa gods heard these verses, their rejoicing was redoubled. They couldn’t control themselves. ‘The host of gods is increasing, and the host of asuras is decreasing!’ Śakra the Lord of Gods saw the Trāyastriṃśa gods rejoicing and being merry, so he addressed them, ‘Gentlemen, would you like to hear about the Tathāgata’s eight unequalled qualities?’</p>
<p>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods said, ‘We would like to hear it!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Lord Śakra replied, “Listen closely, listen closely! Consider it well.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“‘The Buddha’s Dharma is sublime and a good exposition of the wise person’s training. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present with a sublime teaching like that of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“‘The Buddha awakened himself as a result of this teaching. Without any obstacle to his understanding, he enjoys himself. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present awaken themselves with this teaching and have no obstacle to their understanding like the Buddha has.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“‘Gentlemen, after awakening himself with this teaching, the Buddha reveals the way to Nirvāṇa and the gradual approach and entry into extinguishment. It’s like the Gaṅgā River and the Yamunā River. Those two rivers flow into each other and then enter the ocean. The Buddha is likewise. He reveals the way to Nirvāṇa and the gradual approach and entry into extinguishment. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present reveal the way to Nirvāṇa like the Buddha does.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“‘Gentlemen, the Tathāgata has achieved a following of warriors, priests, householders, and ascetics. Wise is the following achieved by the Tathāgata. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present achieve a following like the Buddha has.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“‘Gentlemen, the Tathāgata has achieved a great assembly known as monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present accomplish a great assembly like the Buddha has.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“‘Gentlemen, the Tathāgata’s words and actions correspond. He does what he says, and he says what he does. Thus, he has achieved one teaching and the next. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present whose words and actions correspond and achieve one teaching and the next like the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“‘Gentlemen, the Tathāgata has benefited many and made many happy. He bestows these blessings to gods and humans out of compassion. I’ve not seen a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One in the past, future, or present benefit many and made many happy like the Buddha has.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“‘Gentlemen, these are the Tathāgata’s eight unequalled qualities.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods then said, ‘Whenever there are eight Buddhas who arise in the world, the host of gods would increase greatly, and the host of asuras would diminish!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods also said, ‘Setting aside eight Buddhas, even if seven, six … two Buddhas were to arise in the world, the host of gods would increase greatly, and the host of asuras would diminish. How would it be if there were eight Buddhas?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Śakra the Lord of Gods told the Trāyastriṃśa gods, ‘I’ve heard it from the Buddha, personally received it from him, that it’s impossible for two Buddhas to arise in the world at the same time. If the Tathāgata simply remained in the world for a long time, he would have compassion for many and benefit many. Gods and humans would win their peace. The host of gods would increase greatly, and the host of asuras would diminish.’”</p>
<h3>Great Brahmā Kumāra Arrives</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>Pañcaśikha said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, having gathered up in the Dharma Meeting Hall, the Trāyastriṃśa gods conversed, considered, weighed, and investigated what instructions to issue. Afterward, the four god kings were given their orders. When each accepted their instructions, four god kings took their seats. Not long after they sat down, there was a very unusual light that shined in the four directions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods saw this light and were bewildered by it. ‘Now, this is an unusual light! Isn’t this strange?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Those great spirits and gods who possessed majesty were also surprised. ‘Now, this is an unusual light! Isn’t this strange?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“‘King Great Brahmā then appeared in the form of a child. His head had a five-pointed topknot, and he stood in the air above the assembly of gods. His handsomeness was far beyond that of the assembly. His body was purple gold in color, and his radiance outshined that of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“‘The Trāyastriṃśa gods didn’t get up to greet him, nor did they pay their respects. They didn’t invite him to sit, either. When Brahmā Kumāra went and took a seat, <span class='add'>[the god at that]</span> seat was delighted like a warrior of a water-anointed lineage celebrating and rejoicing when he ascends to the throne. Soon after sitting, Brahmā again transformed himself into the shape of a child whose head was crowned with a five-pointed topknot, and he sat in the sky above the great assembly. He was like a hero sitting securely on his throne, lofty and unmoving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“‘Then he spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“‘The gods of the Trāyastriṃśa<br>
And Lord Śakra are celebrating!<br>
Homage to the Tathāgata,<br>
The king of the highest teaching!</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods said to <span class='add'>[Great Brahmā]</span> Kumāra, ‘When we heard Lord Śakra declare the eight unequalled qualities of the Tathāgata, we rejoiced and danced. We couldn’t control ourselves!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“Brahmā Kumāra said to the Trāyastriṃśa gods, ‘What are the eight unequalled qualities of the Tathāgata? I’d also like to hear it!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“The gods and Lord Śakra then explained the eight unequalled qualities of the Tathāgata for Kumāra. After the Trāyastriṃśa gods and Kumāra had listened to that teaching, their rejoicing was redoubled. They couldn’t control themselves. ‘The host of gods increases, and the host of asuras decreases!’</p>
<h3>The Legend of Great Govinda</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“Kumāra then saw the gods’ rejoicing and merry-making increase. He then told the Trāyastriṃśa gods, ‘Would you like to hear about one unequalled quality <span class='add'>[of the Tathāgata]</span>?’</p>
<p>“The gods said, ‘Excellent! We’d like to hear it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“Kumāra told them, ‘Those of you who’d like to hear it: Listen closely, Listen closely! I’ll tell it to you.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>“He told the gods, ‘In the past when he was a bodhisattva, the Tathāgata was born intelligent and quite knowledgeable. Gentlemen, you should know that long ago in the distant past, there was a king in the world named Diśāmpati, and his first prince was named Reṇu. The king also had a minister named Govinda, and that minister had a son named Jyotipāla. Prince Reṇu was his friend, and they were accompanied by six warrior ministers who were also friends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>“‘When King Diśāmpati wanted to retreat to his palace and have fun and frolic there, he entrusted the affairs of state to his minister Govinda. He would then go into the palace and enjoy the festivities and partake of the five desires.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>“‘Wanting to put the affairs of state in order, the minister Govinda would first consult his son about it, and afterward he’d make his decision. He would also consult his son when there was a disciplinary matter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>“‘Later, Govinda’s life suddenly ended. When King Diśāmpati heard that his life had ended, he felt sorry and saddened. Upset, he said, “Oh! How could I lose such a skilled administrator?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>“‘The prince Reṇu thought to himself, “The loss of Govinda has made the king miserable. Now’s a good time for me to go and console the king. I can’t let the funeral make him more depressed. Why is that? Govinda had a son named Jyotipāla who’s intelligence and learning go beyond his father’s. He can take over managing the affairs of state now.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>“‘Prince Reṇu visited the king and presented the above idea to his father. After listening to what the prince had to say, he entrusted <span class='add'>[the affairs of state]</span> to Jyotipāla. “Now, I place you in your father’s stead and transfer his office to you.” After that office was transferred to Jyotipāla, the king retired to the palace, again entrusting the affairs of state <span class='add'>[to his minister]</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>“‘The indications of Jyotipāla’s governance were bright. He knew what his father had known before, and he also knew things his father hadn’t known. His renown spread until it was heard across the ocean. Everyone under heaven called him “The Great Govinda.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>“‘Great Govinda thought afterward, “Now, King Diśāmpati is getting on in years. There isn’t much left of his life. If the prince succeeded the king, there wouldn’t be difficulties. I’d better first go tell the six warrior ministers, ‘Now, King Diśāmpati is getting on in years. There isn’t much left of his life. If the prince were to succeed the king, there wouldn’t be difficulties. The king’s land would also be divided between you gentlemen. Don’t forget each other on the day of his ascension.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a>“‘Great Govinda then went to the six warrior ministers and told them, ‘Gentlemen, you should know that King Diśāmpati is getting on in years. There isn’t much left of his life. If the prince succeeded the king, there wouldn’t be difficulties. You noble men may go and tell the prince this plan. “We’ve known Your Majesty since he was small. When Your Majesty suffers, we suffer, and when he’s happy, we’re happy. Now, the king is declining with old age. There isn’t much left of his life. If the prince were to succeed the king, there wouldn’t be difficulties. Should Your Majesty ascend the throne, we’ll also be given his lands.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a>“‘After they heard what he said, the six warrior ministers visited the prince and told him the above. The prince replied, “If I were to ascend the throne, how will the kingdom’s lands be distributed?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>“‘Not long after that, the king suddenly passed away, and the ministers sought the prince to install a king on the throne.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a>“‘Once he was enthroned, the king quietly considered this: “Now, it would be fitting to rule the way the previous king did.” He also thought, “Who is capable of this promotion? Great Govinda is the right person for it.” King Reṇu then told Great Govinda, “Now, I assign you to manage the affairs of state in my place. I place my trust in you. Be diligent and serious about it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>“‘After he heard the king’s instructions, Great Govinda accepted his trust, and the king retired to the palace. Great Govinda was then entrusted with managing future affairs of state.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>“‘Great Govinda again thought to himself, “Would it be fitting to visit those six warriors now and ask them what they remember of what we discussed before?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>“‘He immediately visited the warriors and said to them, “Now, do you remember about what we discussed before? The prince has ascended the throne and hid himself deep in the palace to enjoy the five desires. You could go and ask: ‘The king dwells on the heavenly throne and enjoys the five desires. Do you recall what we discussed before?’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>“‘Hearing this said, the six warriors then visited the king. They said to the great king, “The king dwells on the heavenly throne and enjoys the five desires. Do you recall what we discussed before? How shall the land and cities be divided, and who shall rule where?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>“‘The king said, “I haven’t forgotten what we discussed before. I’ll divide the lands and the cities. If it were not you, then who <span class='add'>[would it be to receive them]</span>?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>“‘The king also thought to himself, “The lands of Jambudvīpa are wide internally and narrow externally. Who could divide it into seven parts?” Then he thought, “Only Great Govinda can divide it up.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>“‘The king then told Great Govinda, “You may divide the lands of Jambudvīpa. Divide them into seven parts.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“‘Great Govinda then quickly divided the continent. The king ruled from a province containing the capital city, and the remainder was divided into provinces and given to the six warriors.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc51'>SC 51</a>“‘The king was delighted and said, “It’s exactly as I wanted!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a>“‘The six warriors were also delighted. “It’s exactly as we wanted, achieved by the ability of Great Govinda!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a>“‘The six warriors and the king also each thought to themselves, “Now that my kingdom is established, I need a prime minister, but who would be qualified? Someone like Great Govinda! I will employ him to manage the kingdom’s affairs.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>“‘The six warrior kings then summoned Govinda and told him, “My kingdom needs a prime minister. You shall manage its affairs for me.” The six kingdoms then each were given the prime minister’s seal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>“‘After Great Govinda received the prime minister’s seals, the six kings went to their palaces to enjoy their leisure time, and the affairs of their kingdoms were entrusted to him. He managed the affairs of the seven kingdoms, and there was nothing he couldn’t handle.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“‘There were at the time seven great householders in the kingdom to whom Govinda delegated his duties. He also instructed 700 priests who chanted the scriptures. The seven kings regarded Prime Minister Great Govinda with respect, just as they would a god. The seven householders in each kingdom regarded him like a great king, and the 700 priests regarded him like Brahmā.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“‘The seven kings, seven great householders, and 700 priests all thought to themselves, “Prime Minister Great Govinda often meets with Brahmā, talking, sitting, and getting up with him as friends.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“‘Great Govinda was silently aware, “The seven kings, seven householders, and <span class='add'>[700]</span> priests think that I often meet with Brahmā, talking, sitting, and getting up with him as friends, but I don’t really see Brahmā, nor do I speak with him. I shouldn’t feed this with silence; it would be dishonest to accept this praise. Also, I’ve heard from past generations that when someone dwells in a secluded place during the four months of summer and cultivates the four immeasurables, Brahmā will come down and meet with him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“‘Govinda then went to each of the seven kings and said, “Great king, please attend to the kingdom’s affairs. I’m going to cultivate the four immeasurables during the four months of summer.”</p>
<p>“‘The seven kings told him, “Do what you think is fitting.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“‘Great Govinda in turn told the seven householders, “You will each need to work on your own. I’m going to cultivate the four immeasurables during the four months of summer.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>“‘Great Govinda then had a secluded abode built near his city and retired there to cultivate the four immeasurables during the four months of summer. Afterward, Brahmā didn’t come down to him. Govinda thought to himself, “I’ve heard ancient sayings from previous generations that when someone cultivates the four immeasurables during the four months of summer, Brahmā comes down and appears. It’s tranquil now, but there’s not even a momentary blur of him to be seen.”</p>

<h3>Teaching the Ultimate Path</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc98'>SC 98</a>Pañcaśikha said, “It was for this reason that I came here. Indeed, Bhagavān! Was that Great Govinda the Bhagavān?

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc99'>SC 99</a>The Buddha asked Pañcaśikha, “Was Great Govinda a different person at that time? Don’t make this observation. It was me then. At the time that I lifted up a kingdom, men and women walked towards me.

Hail, Great Govinda, the prime minister of the seven kings!’ They would say this three times.</p>

He taught the Dharma, and his disciples accepted and practiced it until their bodies broke up and their lives ended. They were born in the Brahma Heaven. Next, those whose practice was shallow were born in the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven. Next were those born in the Nirmāṇarati Heaven … Tuṣita Heaven … Yama Heaven … Trāyastriṃśa Heaven … with the Four God Kings … into great families of warriors … priests … householders who could enjoy their desires freely.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc101'>SC 101</a>“Pañcaśikha, that Great Govinda’s disciples left home without doubts, and their rewards and teachings were still not the ultimate path. He couldn’t make them attain the ultimate religious life or reach the abode of peace. The best of them were born as high as the Brahma Heaven.</p>

They end up in Nirvāṇa. Of those disciples to whom I teach the Dharma and who accept its practice, those who discard the contaminants and become uncontaminated are liberated at heart and liberated in wisdom. In the present life, they themselves realize: ‘Birth and death have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I’m not subject to another existence.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc103'>SC 103</a>“Next are those whose practice is shallow and end the five lower bonds. They Parinirvāṇa in the heavens and don’t return here again. Next are those who end the three bonds and weaken lust, hate, and delusion. They’re reborn in the world once and Parinirvāṇa. Next are those who end the three bonds and attain stream entry. They don’t fall to bad destinies and are reborn not more than seven times. They are sure to attain Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc104'>SC 104</a>“Pañcaśikha, my disciples leave home without doubts, and they possess the rewards and teachings of the ultimate path, ultimate religious life, and ultimate peace. They end up at Nirvāṇa.”</p>
