<h3>Asura King Rāhu</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc418'>SC 418</a>“When the Asura King <span class='add'>Rāhu</span> wants to go sightseeing at Śāla Park, he thinks of Asura King Vemacitrin. Asura King Vemacitrin then thinks, ‘Asura King Rāhu is thinking of me now!’ He gets himself ready and rides a treasure chariot to Asura King Rāhu while surrounded by a countless assembly of servants.

He goes before the Asura King and then stands to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc422'>SC 422</a>“The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King also thinks of the lesser asuras.

They go before the Asura King and then stand to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc423'>SC 423</a>“King Rāhu then gets himself ready by putting on precious ornaments and clothes. He rides a treasure chariot to Śāla Grove while surrounded by countless great assemblies. A spontaneous wind blows the gate open, a spontaneous wind clears the ground, and another spontaneous wind scatters flowers on the ground until they’re knee-deep.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc424'>SC 424</a>“After entering the park, King Rāhu entertains himself with the others for one day, two days … or seven days. When they’re finished with their recreation, they return to their own palaces. After that, they go sightseeing at Most Marvelous Forest, Śālmalī Forest, and Nandana forest in the same way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc425'>SC 425</a>“King Rāhu always has five great asura servants who attend to him left and right. The first is named Grasper. The second is named Great Strength. The third is named Barbaric. The fourth is named Chief. The fifth is named Vanquisher. These five great asuras are always serving him left and right.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc426'>SC 426</a>“That King Rāhu’s palace hall is both beneath and above an ocean that’s supported by four winds. The first is called the standing wind. The second is called the holding wind. The third is called the immovable wind. The fourth is called the steadfast wind. They support that ocean’s water, which hangs in the sky like a floating cloud. Even the water that’s 10,000 yojanas away from that asura palace never falls down. Such are the fortune, virtue, and majesty of the Asura King.”</p>
