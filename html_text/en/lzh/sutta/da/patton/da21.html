  <h1>Brahmā’s Shaking</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to Magadha accompanied by an assembly of 1,250 great monks. Wandering among the people, they reached the bamboo grove and stopped to stay at the royal palace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, there was an ascetic named Supriya who had a disciple named Brahmadatta. This teacher and student were always following the Buddha. The ascetic Supriya criticized the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks in countless ways, and his disciple Brahmadatta praised the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks in countless ways. The teacher and his student both felt differently and contradicted each other. Why is that? It was because of their different customs, different views, and different friends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>It was then that a group of monks assembled in the meeting hall after soliciting alms to have this discussion: “Amazing and rare are the great miraculous power and majestic virtue possessed by the Bhagavān. He fully knows the intentions and destinations of sentient beings, but the ascetic Supriya and his disciple follow the Tathāgata and the Saṅgha of monks. The ascetic Supriya criticizes the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha in countless ways, and his disciple Brahmadatta praises the Tathāgata, Dharma, and Saṅgha in countless ways. The teacher and his student both feel differently as a result of their different customs, different views, and different friends.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>It was then that the Bhagavān overheard the monks having that discussion with his heavenly ear that surpasses the human ear. The Bhagavān emerged from his quiet abode, went to the meeting hall, and sat in front of that large assembly. Although he knew, he still asked them, “Monks, what’s the reason you’ve gathered here in the meeting hall? What are you discussing?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The monks then said to the Buddha, “After soliciting alms, we gathered here in the meeting hall to have this discussion: ‘Amazing and rare are the great miraculous power and majestic virtue possessed by the Bhagavān. He fully knows the intentions and destinations of sentient beings, but the ascetic Supriya and his disciple always follow the Tathāgata and the Sangha of monks. The ascetic Supriya criticizes the Tathāgata, Dharma, and Saṅgha in countless ways, and his disciple Brahmadatta praises the Tathāgata, Dharma, and Saṅgha in countless ways. The teacher and his student both feel differently as a result of their different customs, different views, and different friends.’ We gathered here in the meeting hall to discuss this situation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Bhagavān then told the monks, “If someone criticizes the Tathāgata, Dharma, and the Saṅgha in some way, don’t allow yourselves to feel angry and have harmful intent toward them. Why is that? If they criticize me, the Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks and you feel angry and have harmful intent, it’ll result in your own downfall; therefore, don’t allow yourself to feel angry and have harmful intent toward them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Monks, if someone praises the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha, that isn’t enough for you to feel delighted and rejoice. Why is that? If you feel delighted, then it will be your downfall; therefore, you shouldn’t feel delighted. Why is that? These are minor matters of deportment and observing precepts. Ordinary, uneducated people don’t penetrate the <span class='add'>[Dharma’s]</span> profound meaning, so they praise only what they see <span class='add'>[with their eyes]</span>.</p>
<h3>Minor Matters of Conduct</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“What are the minor matters of deportment and observing precepts that ordinary, uneducated people only praise when they see them?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“There’s this praise: ‘The ascetic Gautama has ceased killing, desisted from killing, and discarded swords and staves. He feels remorse <span class='add'>[for wrongdoing]</span> and compassion for all <span class='add'>[living things]</span>.’ This is a minor matter of deportment and observing precepts for which ordinary, uneducated people praise the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“There’s also this praise: ‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded taking what’s not given, ceased taking what’s not given, and doesn’t have any thoughts of stealing.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“There’s also this praise: ‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded lustful desire and purely cultivates the religious life. He simply guards the precepts and doesn’t engage in sexual intercourse. His conduct is pure and clean.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“There’s also this praise: ‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded and ceased false speech. His words being sincere and his statements being true, he doesn’t deceive worldly people.’ … ‘The ascetic Gautama discarded and ceased duplicity. He doesn’t say things here to cause misunderstandings there or say things there to cause misunderstandings here. When there’s conflict, he brings people together. Once they are united, he increases their joy. His words and statements don’t divide those who are unified. His heart is sincere, and he speaks when it’s appropriate.’ … ‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded and ceased harsh speech. If there are crude words that hurt people, increase feelings of resentment, and nurture hatred, he doesn’t use any of those crude words. He always delights people’s mind with skillful words that are desired by many, and people don’t grow tired of hearing them. He only speaks these words.’ … ‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded and ceased fancy speech. He speaks when it’s appropriate, speaks truly, speaks beneficially, speaks about principles, speaks about discipline, and stops speaking otherwise. He only speaks these words.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“‘The ascetic Gautama has discarded and parted with drinking alcohol. He isn’t attached to fragrant flowers, doesn’t watch performances, doesn’t sit on high seats, doesn’t eat at the wrong time, and doesn’t take gold or silver. He doesn’t take care of wives, children, workers, or servants. He doesn’t take care of elephants, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, or other birds and animals. He doesn’t take care of war elephants, cavalry, charioteers, or infantry. He doesn’t take care of farmland or plant the five grains. He doesn’t bully people with his fists. He doesn’t trick people with weights and scales. He doesn’t buy and sell agreements or negotiate them. He doesn’t take on or touch debts that grow without end. He doesn’t engage in secret plots, doesn’t act differently to people’s faces and behind their backs, and doesn’t act at the wrong time. He takes care of his body and eats as much as fills his stomach. Wherever he goes, his robe and bowl follow him, just as a flying bird’s body has a pair of wings.’ These are minor matters of observing the precepts for which ordinary, uneducated people praise the Buddha.</p>
<h3>Wrong Livelihoods</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who accept the faithful gifts of others and try to hoard robes, food, and drinks insatiably. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and work in their own occupations, like planting trees to serve as shelters for demons and spirits. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and pursue ways of getting benefits like high and wide beds made of ivory and assorted jewels and various embroidered carpets, blankets, and cushions. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and pursue ways of adorning themselves. They rub their bodies with ghee, wash with perfume, apply fragrant powders, comb their hair with fragrant liquids, wear beautiful flower garlands, dye their eyes dark blue, and paint their faces. They wear metal rings and strings that are clean, look at themselves in mirrors, wear valuable leather shoes, wear pure white over their clothes, and carry parasols, fans, flags, and banners as ornaments. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who focus on entertainment. They play games on boards with eight squares, ten squares, and a hundred or a thousand squares, entertaining themselves in various ways. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and just talk about pointless things that obstruct the path. <span class='add'>[They discuss]</span> subjects like kings, battles, warhorses, officials, ministers, riding chariots and horses, and enjoying themselves in parks. They have conversations while they lie down, rise, and walk about women’s affairs, clothing, food and drink, and relatives. They discuss the subject of finding treasures in the ocean, too. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and just pursue wrong livelihoods. They flatter people with beautiful expressions or appear to criticize them, and they pursue profit with profit. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and just argue with each other. Whether in parks, near ponds, or in halls, they blame each other: ‘I know the sūtras and discipline; you know nothing.’ ‘I’m on the correct path; you’re going down the wrong road.’ ‘Either you put what’s first last, or you put what’s last first.’ ‘I can endure <span class='add'>[this]</span>; you aren’t able to endure it.’ ‘Your words aren’t correct.’ ‘If you have any doubts, you should come and ask me; I can answer everything.’ The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and pursue a messenger’s livelihood. Whether it’s for kings, the king’s ministers, priests, or gentlemen, they relay their messages. They travel from here to there and there to here. They take a message here and deliver it there or take a message there and deliver it here. They might do this themselves or instruct others to do it. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and just study military strategy and combat. They might train in the use of swords and staves or the bow and arrow. They might fight animals like chickens, dogs, pigs, sheep, elephants, horses, cattle, and camels or fight men and women. They might make different kinds of music using horns and drums, singing and dancing. They might climb poles, perform handstands, and practice various acrobatics. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods such as telling the signs of men and women’s good and bad fortune, their beauty and ugliness, or the signs of livestock. They do this seeking to profit by it. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods. They summon demons and spirits or drive them away with various rites and prayers. In countless ways, they frighten and afflict people. They gather and scatter <span class='add'>[people]</span> and cause them pain and pleasure. They can also prevent miscarriages, produce clothing, and make people act like donkeys with spells, or make people blind, deaf, and dumb. They demonstrate these arts with their palms together raised to the sun and moon, and they practice asceticism in pursuit of profit. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods. They might perform spells for people <span class='add'>[that cause]</span> illness, chant evil and good spells, and practice medicine with acupuncture, cauterization, and herbs and minerals to cure various ailments. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods. They might perform spells of water and fire, spells for demons, chant warrior spells, elephant spells, and spells for limbs. They might perform spells or make charms for making households peaceful, or they might perform spells to understand <span class='add'>[things]</span> burnt by fire or chewed by mice. They might chant from books of discerning death and life, chant from books about dreams, tell fortunes using people’s hands and faces, chant from books of gods, or chant from language books. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods. They make predictions based on the heavens and seasons: “It will rain … it won’t rain … the harvest will be bountiful … the harvest will be poor … many people will fall ill … few will be ill … there’ll be terrible <span class='add'>[events]</span> … there’ll be peace.” They might discuss earthquakes, comets, solar and lunar eclipses, stellar occultations and non-occultations and where they will happen, and they’re able to predict them. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“‘There are other ascetics and priests who eat the faithful alms of others and practice teachings that obstruct the path, making their living from wrong livelihoods. They might say, “This country will win; that country is not their equal … that country will win; this country is not their equal.” They divine the fortune and misfortune and discuss the flourishing and demise <span class='add'>[of different countries]</span>. The ascetic Gautama doesn’t do such things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“Monks, these are the minor matters of observing the precepts for which ordinary, uneducated people praise the Buddha.</p>
<h3>Views about Past Eons</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Moreover, there’s another teaching that illuminates what’s profound, subtle, and great, but it’s only the noble disciples who praise this teaching of the Tathāgata’s. What is that profound, subtle, great, and illuminating teaching for which the noble disciples praise the Tathāgata?</p>

<h3>Self and World Are Eternal</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>“Ascetics and priests create this eternalist theory about past eons: ‘Self and the world always exists.’ They all enter four views.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>“What are the reasons those ascetics and priests create eternalist theories about past eons, saying that self and the world always exist, and they don’t go beyond these four views that they enter?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>“Some ascetics and priests use various methods to enter a samādhi of mind through which they remember 20 eons of <span class='add'>[world]</span> formation and destruction. They say, ‘Self and the world are eternal. This is true, the rest is false. Why is that? Using various methods, I entered a samādhi of mind through which I remembered 20 eons of <span class='add'>[world]</span> formation and destruction. During that time, sentient beings neither increased nor decreased. They always came together and didn’t scatter. By this, I know: “Self and the world are eternal.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>“Some ascetics and priests possess quick intelligence and are skilled observers. Using the methods of quick intelligence and observation, they investigate the truth as they see it themselves.

<h3>Self and World Are Half Eternal and Half Impermanent</h3>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>“At the beginning of this eon of formation, there was a sentient being whose merits ended, whose life ended, and whose practice ended. When their life ended in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they were born in an empty Brahma Heaven. This being’s mind craved that birthplace and so was born there. It also wished for other sentient beings to be born there, too.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>“After this sentient being was born according to its craving and wish, there were other sentient beings whose lives, practices, and merits were exhausted. When their lives ended in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they were reborn in that empty Brahma Heaven. The sentient being who was born there first thought, ‘Here, I am Brahma, Great Brahmā! I appeared spontaneously; it’s impossible that another created me. I know all meanings and scriptures, and I’m sovereign over a thousand worlds. I am the most honored who’s able to transform himself and who’s sublime, supreme, and the father of sentient beings. I was here first by myself, and those other sentient beings came later. I created those sentient beings who came later.’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“After the lives and practices of those brahma sentient beings are exhausted, they are born in the world and gradually grow up.

They say, ‘That Great Brahmā was able to create himself; no other could create him. He knows all meanings and scriptures, and he’s sovereign over a thousand worlds. He’s the most honored who’s able to transform himself and who’s sublime, supreme, and the father of sentient beings. Everlasting and unchanging is that Brahmā who created us, but we are impermanent, changing, and unable to last long.

Then they say, ‘Those sentient beings that don’t forget themselves while watching each other one after the other are everlasting and unchanging.

<h3>The Net of Views</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc148'>SC 148</a>“Some ascetics and priests create eternalist theories and say that self and the world are eternal. Those ascetics and priests regarding this possess the knowledge of <span class='add'>[past]</span> births, which is caused by a different faith, different desire, different learning, different relations, different understanding, different view, different samādhi, and different tolerance. Because it rarely occurs, it’s called an attainment … each ground of views is the same up to Nirvāṇa in the present life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc149'>SC 149</a>“Ascetics and priests create eternalist theories and say that the world is eternal. As a result of being conditioned by that ascertainment, they produce and give rise to craving, but they aren’t aware of it themselves. Being defiled and attached to craving, they submit to those cravings… each ground of views is the same up to Nirvāṇa in the present life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc150'>SC 150</a>“Some ascetics and priests create eternalist theories about past eons and say that the world is eternal. They do so as a result of being conditioned by contact. It would be impossible for them to establish their theories unless they were conditioned by contact… each ground of views is the same up to Nirvāṇa in the present.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc151'>SC 151</a>“Some ascetics and priests each speak according to their views about past and future eons. They all enter these 62 views by doing so. They each speak according to their views, and they all depend on those views, which they don’t go beyond.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc152'>SC 152</a>“It’s like a fisherman who covers the top of a small pond with a fine-meshed net. He knows that whatever kind of aquatic life in the pond that enters his net won’t have a way to escape and won’t go beyond it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc153'>SC 153</a>“Ascetics and priests are likewise. They make diverse statements about past and future eons, and they all enter these 62 views and don’t go beyond them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc154'>SC 154</a>“If monks really know the accumulation, cessation, enjoyment, fault, and escape of the six contacts, that’s the supreme escape from those views. The Tathāgata himself knows that his birth and death has ended. Those who have bodies do so because they desire the merits to be liberated as gods or humans. If they have no body, then gods and worldly people have no basis for that. They then are like a palm tree that’s been cut at its root; it doesn’t grow anymore. The Buddha is likewise; he has ended birth and death and won’t be born again.”</p>
<h3>The Sūtra’s Title</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc155'>SC 155</a>When the Buddha spoke this teaching, this great realm of a thousand worlds quaked and shook in six ways. At that moment, Ānanda was behind the Buddha fanning him. He bared his right shoulder and knelt with his palms together. He said, “This teaching is profound! What’s its name? How should it be accepted and remembered?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc156'>SC 156</a>The Buddha told Ānanda, “This sūtra should be called the ‘Shaking of Meaning,’ ‘Shaking of the Teaching,’ ‘Shaking of Views,’ ‘Shaking of Māra,’ and ‘Shaking of Brahmā.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc157'>SC 157</a>When Ānanda heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and approved.</p>
