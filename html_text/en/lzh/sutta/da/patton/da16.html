<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa of Rājagṛha. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān put on his robe and took his bowl into the city to solicit alms. At the time, there was a prominent man’s son named Sujata in Rājagṛha. Early in the morning, he left the city to go for a walk in a park. He bathed first, wetting his entire body. He then bowed in all directions around him: To the east, west, south, north, above, and below.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then saw Sujata bathing before going for his walk in a park, wetting his entire body, and bowing in all directions. Upon seeing this, the Bhagavān went to Sujata and asked him: “Why did you leave the city in the early morning to go to a park, wet your entire body, and bow in all directions?”</p>
<p>Sujata then said to the Buddha, “My father’s death is imminent, and he gave me this instruction: ‘When you go to bow, you should first bow to the east, south, west, north, above, and below.’ I don’t dare not carry out my father’s instruction, so after I’ve bathed, I first salute while facing east and then bow to the east. I do this for all the directions to the south, west, north, above, and below.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Bhagavān then told Sujata, “Prominent man’s son, these directions are just names. It’s not that we don’t have this practice, but we don’t bow to these six directions to pay respect to them in my noble teaching.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Sujata said to the Buddha, “Please, Bhagavān! It would be good if you explained for me the way you bow to the six directions in the noble teaching!”</p>
<p>The Buddha told the prominent man’s son, “Listen closely, listen closely! Consider it well, for I will explain this for you.”</p>
<p>Sujata replied, “Very well. I’d be glad to hear it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “Suppose a prominent man or his son knows four binding actions and doesn’t do bad actions on four grounds. Moreover, he’s able to know six actions that squander wealth. That’s to say, Sujata, this prominent man or his son parts with four bad actions and pays homage to the six directions. It will be good for his present life, and he’ll obtain good results in later lives. It will be the source for this in his present life and later lives. In the present life, he be commended by wise people and gain this one worldly reward: When his body breaks up and his life ends, he’ll be born in a heavenly good place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Sujata, you should know, the four binding actions are 1. killing beings, 2. stealing, 3. engaging in sex, and 4. false speech. These are the four binding actions. What are the four grounds? They are 1. desire, 2. anger, 3. fear, and 4. delusion. If a prominent man or his son does bad actions on these four grounds, then he will decline <span class='add'>[in reputation]</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>After saying this, the Buddha restated it in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Desire, anger, fear, and delusion:<br>
Someone who has these four qualities<br>
Sees their reputation decline daily,<br>
Like the moon approaching its last day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “If a prominent man or his son doesn’t do bad actions on these four grounds, then he’ll improve <span class='add'>[in reputation]</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The Bhagavān then restated this in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“One who doesn’t do bad actions<br>
In desire, anger, fear, and delusion<br>
Will improve in reputation daily,<br>
Like the moon approaching fullness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “The six actions that squander wealth are 1. indulging in alcohol, 2. gambling, 3. self-indulgence, 4. getting carried away at musical performances, 5. associating with bad friends, and 6. idleness. These are the six acts that squander wealth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Sujata, suppose a prominent man or his son understands these four binding actions, doesn’t do evil actions on these four grounds, and knows the six actions that squander wealth. Doing this, Sujata, he can part with these four grounds and make offerings to the six directions. It will be good for his present life and good in later lives. It’ll be the source for this in the present life and in later lives. In the present, he’ll be praised by wise people and gain this one worldly reward: When his body breaks up and his life ends, he’ll be born in a heavenly good place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Sujata, you should know that drinking alcohol has six defects: 1. Loss of wealth, 2. becoming ill, 3. fighting, 4. circulation of a bad reputation, 5. sudden outbursts of anger, and 6. a daily loss in wisdom. Sujata, if they drink alcohol, that prominent man or his son’s family and property with decrease day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Sujata, gambling has six defects. What are the six? 1. Daily loss of wealth, 2. enemies are made by winning, 3. being rebuked by wise people, 4. not being trusted by people, 5. estrangement from people, and 6. it causes thoughts of stealing. Sujata, engaging in gambling has these six defects. If they gamble, that prominent man or his son’s family and property will decrease day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Self-indulgence has six defects: 1. Not protecting oneself, 2. not protecting one’s property, 3. not protecting one’s children, 4. being in constant fear, 5. being constantly trapped in painful and bad qualities, and 6. delighting in falsehoods. These are the six defects of self-indulgence. If a prominent man or his son engages in self-indulgence, his family and property will decrease day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Sujata, getting carried away at musical performances also has six defects: 1. Seeking singing, 2. seeking dancing and 3. seeking musical instruments, 4. panica, 5. talava, and 6. suhana. These are the six defects of music. If a prominent man or his son doesn’t stop indulging in music, his family and property will decrease day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Associating with bad friends also has six defects: 1. One’s ways become deceitful, 2. preferring private places, 3. tempting people from other households, 4. scheming to get others’ possessions, 5. directing profits to oneself, and 6. liking to publicize the faults of others. These are the six defects of bad friends. If a prominent man or his son doesn’t stop associating with bad friends, his family and property will decrease day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>Idleness has six defects: 1. One doesn’t make much effort to cultivate when they’re fortunate and happy, 2. not making much effort to cultivate when in poverty, 3. not making much effort to cultivate when it’s cold, 4. not making much effort to cultivate when it’s hot, 5. not making much effort to cultivate in the morning, and 6. not make much effort to cultivate in the evening. If a prominent man or his son don’t stop being idle, his family and property will decrease day by day.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>After saying this, the Buddha restated it in verse:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “There are four enemies who resemble friends that you should know and recognize. What are the four? 1. Those who submit out of fear, 2. who use beautiful words, 3. who follow out of respect, and 4. who are bad friends.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “There are four things about those who submit out of fear. What are the four? 1. They take back when they’ve given, 2. they give little expecting more <span class='add'>[in return]</span>, 3. their friendship is forced because of fear, and 4. they make friends for their own gain. These are the four things about those who submit out of fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>The Buddha told Sujata, “There are also four things about friends who use beautiful words. What are the four? 1. They follow others whether they are good or bad, 2. abandon them when there are difficulties, 3. are welcoming in public but stop in private, and 4. refuse to help when misfortune strikes. These are the four things about friends who use beautiful words.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“There are four things about friends who follow out of respect. What are the four? 1.

<p>“One who submits out of fear is a forced friend;<br>
The friend who uses beautiful words is likewise.<br>
Followers out of respect are false friends,<br>
And bad companions make bad friends.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>The Buddha addressed Sujata, “There are four friends who bring many benefits when befriended and who will help and protect a person. What are the four? 1. Those who stop what’s wrong, 2. who are merciful, 3. who are beneficial, and 4. who are cooperative. These four friends bring many benefits when befriended and will help and protect a person. They should be befriended.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“Sujata, there are four things about those who stop what’s wrong, which bring many benefits and help and protect a person. What are the four? 1. They can stop someone who they see are doing evil, 2. they show people what’s honest and correct, 3. they’re kind, sympathetic, and mindful, and 4. they show a person the road to heaven. These are the four things about those who stop what’s wrong, which bring many benefits and help and protect a person.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“Furthermore, there are four things about those who are merciful: 1. They are delighted to see another’s gain, 2. they are saddened to see a person do evil, 3. they praise others’ virtues, and 4. they can restrain others when seeing them speak badly.

The Tathāgata’s explanation is like turning upright what’s overturned, opening up something closed, bringing understanding to what’s confused, and a lamp in a dark room to those with eyes to see. He awakens the fool who’s in the dark with countless methods that make the clean teaching plain.</p>

Starting today, I will not kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, or drink alcohol for the rest of my life.”</p>
