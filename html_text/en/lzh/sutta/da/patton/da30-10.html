<h2>Chapter 10: War</h2>
<h3>Vemacitrin’s Bonds</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc720'>SC 720</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the gods and asuras went to war. At the time, Śakra the Lord of Gods gave the Trāyastriṃśa gods this order: ‘All of you, go and do battle with them. If you are victorious, tie up the asura Vemacitrin with five bonds and bring him to the Sudharma Meeting Hall. I want to look at him.’ Accepting Lord Śakra’s instructions, the Trāyastriṃśa gods equipped themselves <span class='add'>with armor and weapons</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc721'>SC 721</a>“The asura Vemacitrin gave the asuras this order: ‘All of you, go and do battle with them. If you are victorious, tie up Śakra the Lord of Gods with five bonds and bring him to the Saptaśirīṣa Meeting Hall. I want to look at him.’ Accepting the asura Vemacitrin’s instructions, the asuras equipped themselves <span class='add'>with armor and weapons</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc722'>SC 722</a>“The hosts of gods and asuras then fought a battle. The gods were victorious, and the asuras retreated. The Trāyastriṃśa gods tied up the asura king with five bonds, brought him to the Sudharma Hall, and showed him to Lord Śakra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc723'>SC 723</a>“When the asura king saw the heavens, he was delighted, and an aspiration arose in him. He thought, ‘This place is supreme! Perhaps I will live here. How could I go back to the asura palace?’ When that thought occurred to him, he was freed from the five bonds and was presented with five delights. When the asura had the thought to return to his own palace, then the five bonds tied him back up, and the five delights left him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc724'>SC 724</a>“The bonds tying up the asura then became quite strong. The bonds that tie up Māra are even stronger than his was. Someone who posits a self is bound by Māra. Someone who doesn’t posit a self is freed from Māra’s bonds. The feeling of self is a bond. The feeling of craving is a bond.<span class='add'>n</span> ‘I will exist’ is a bond. ‘I will not exist’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have form’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have no form’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have form and no form’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have conception’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have no conception’ is a bond. ‘I’ll have conception and no conception’ is a bond. ‘Self’ is a great trouble, an abscess, and a thorn.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc725'>SC 725</a>“Therefore, a noble disciple knows that ‘self’ is a great trouble, an abscess, and a thorn. They abandon the notions of self and cultivate selfless conduct. They regard that ‘self’ as a heavy burden, as reckless, and as existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc726'>SC 726</a>“Something that has a self would be conditioned, and something that has no self would be conditioned. Something with form is conditioned, and something without form is conditioned. Something with and without form is conditioned. Something with conception is conditioned, and something without conception is conditioned. Something with and without conception is conditioned. Something that’s conditioned is a great trouble, an abscess, and a thorn. Therefore, a noble disciple abandons being conditioned and practices to be unconditioned.”</p>
<h3>Śakra Tolerates Vemacitrin’s Insults</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc727'>SC 727</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the gods and asuras went to war.

As ’Citrin insults him to his face.<br>
He listens quietly to his harsh words.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc732'>SC 732</a>“Śakra the Lord of Gods also spoke in verse to answer his attendant:</p>

What wise man would<br>
Argue with an ignorant person?’</p>

Make that fool admit his mistake!</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc734'>SC 734</a>“Lord Śakra replied to his attendant in verse:</p>

Fools are insulting, and the wise are silent;<br>
Then they’re honestly defeated.’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc735'>SC 735</a>“The attendant again spoke in verse to Lord Śakra:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>

To avoid damaging his wise conduct,<br>
But that stupid person<br>
Will say the king is afraid of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> The fool doesn’t assess himself<br>
And thinks himself a match for the king.<br>
He’d rush to a certain death,<br>
While the king wants to retreat like a bull.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc736'>SC 736</a>“Lord Śakra again replied to his attendant in verse:</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc737'>SC 737</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Was Śakra the Lord of Gods another person at the time? Don’t have this view. At that time, Śakra the Lord of Gods was me. I was cultivating tolerance and not behaving violently. I was constantly praising tolerant people. If some wise person wants to set out on my path, they should cultivate patient silence and not feel animosity.”</p>
<h3>Defeating the Asuras with Gentle Words</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc738'>SC 738</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the Trāyastriṃśa gods and the asuras went to war. Śakra the Lord of Gods said to the asura ’Citrin, ‘Friend, why are you equipped with weapons? Do you harbor ill-will and want to fight me? Now, I’ll have a discussion of doctrine with you to determine who wins and who loses.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc739'>SC 739</a>“That asura ’Citrin said to Lord Śakra, ‘Even if I did put down these weapons and stop to debate doctrine with you, who’d decide who won and who lost?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc740'>SC 740</a>Lord Śakra instructed him, ‘We will simply hold a discussion. Those who are wise in your host and in my host of gods will decide who wins and who loses.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc741'>SC 741</a>“The asura said to Lord Śakra, ‘You begin with a verse.’</p>
<p>“Lord Śakra replied, ‘You are the elder god. You should be the first to speak.’</p>
<p>“The asura ’Citrin then spoke a verse to Lord Śakra:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “‘Don’t bow to that fool now;<br>
He may become hard to bear after this!<br>
You ought to whip him with a cane;<br>
Make that fool admit his mistake!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc742'>SC 742</a>“After he said this verse, the host of asuras rejoiced and cheered, saying, ‘Excellent!’ The host of gods were silent and had nothing to say.</p>

They create the root of conflict, increase the bond of anger, and establish the source of the three existences. Śakra the Lord of Gods’ verses attack no one, like not drawing a sword against an opponent. They don’t create conflict, don’t increase the bond of anger, and put an end to the source for the three existences. What the Lord of Gods has said is good, and what the asura has said is not good. The gods are the winners, and the asuras are the losers!’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc753'>SC 753</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Was Śakra the Lord of Gods another person at the time? Don’t have this view. Why is that? <span class='add'>Śakra the Lord of Gods</span> was me. That time, I defeated the host of asuras with gentle words.”</p>
<h3>Defeating the Asuras with Compassion</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc754'>SC 754</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the gods and asuras again went to war. That time, the asuras were the victors, and the gods weren’t their equal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc755'>SC 755</a>“Śakra the Lord of Gods road a thousand-spoked treasure chariot as he fled in terror. In the middle of the road, he saw a nest in a sal tree, and a pair of chicks was in the nest. He told his driver in verse:</p>

<p> “‘That tree with two birds in it,<br>

Don’t injure those two birds!’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc756'>SC 756</a>“Hearing Lord Śakra’s verse, his driver immediately steered the chariot to avoid the birds. The chariot then was headed toward the asuras, and the host of asuras saw his treasure chariot turning around in the distance. Those soldiers then said to each other, ‘Śakra the Lord of Gods is headed towards us in a thousand-spoked treasure chariot! He must want to come back and fight us! How could that be!?’ The host of asuras then were routed. The gods won a victory, and the asuras retreated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc757'>SC 757</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Was Lord Śakra another person at the time? Don’t have that view. Why is that? <span class='add'>Śakra the Lord of Gods</span> was me. That time, I was engendering compassion for sentient beings. Monks, you’ve left home to cultivate the path in my teaching. You ought to engender compassion and sympathy for all beings.”</p>
<h3>Śakra’s Victory Hall</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc758'>SC 758</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the gods and asuras went to war. That time, the gods were the victors, and the asuras retreated. Śakra the Lord of Gods returned to his palace after that victory and built a hall that he named Supremacy. It was a hundred yojanas long from east to west, and sixty yojanas wide from north to south. That hall had a hundred rooms, and the rooms had seven curtained balconies. There were seven beautiful women on each balcony, and each beautiful woman had seven servants. Śakra the Lord of Gods didn’t withhold from those beautiful women any supplies of clothing, meals, or ornaments. He received these fortunes as a result of his past deeds. Being victorious in battle against the asuras, he rejoiced and built this hall, so it was called the Hall of Supremacy. No other hall was comparable to it in a thousand worlds, so it was called Supremacy.”</p>
<h3>Desire Is the Cause of Warfare</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc759'>SC 759</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once the Asura <span class='add'>King Rāhu</span> thought to himself, ‘I have great authority, and my miraculous powers aren’t few, but the Trāyastriṃśa, sun, and moon gods are always in the sky roam around my summit freely. Now, I think I’ll take the sun and the moon and make them into earrings so I could travel freely!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc760'>SC 760</a>“The Asura King’s anger flared, and he thought about the asura *Prahata. The asura *Prahata then thought to himself, ‘The Asura King is thinking of me now! We should quickly get ready!’ He ordered those to his right and left to equip themselves with weapons. He then rode a treasure chariot to the Asura King while surrounded by a countless host of asuras. He went before the Asura King and then stood to one side.</p>

He then rode a treasure chariot to the Asura King while surrounded by a countless host of asuras. He went before the Asura King and then stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc762'>SC 762</a>“The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King also thought about the asura Vemacitrin.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc763'>SC 763</a>“The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King also thought of the great minister of asuras. The great minister of asuras thought to himself, ‘The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King is thinking of me now! We should quickly get ready!’ He ordered those to his right and left to equip themselves with weapons. He then rode a treasure chariot to the Asura King while surrounded by a countless host of asuras. He went before the <span class='add'>Asura</span> King and then stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc764'>SC 764</a>“The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King also thought of the lesser asuras. The lesser asuras then thought to themselves, ‘The <span class='add'>Asura</span> King is thinking of me now! We should quickly get ready!’ They got ready and equipped themselves with weapons. They then went to the Asura King with countless other asuras. They went before the <span class='add'>Asura</span> King and then stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc765'>SC 765</a>“The Asura King Rāhu then got himself ready, donning treasure armor. He rode a treasure chariot while surrounded by countless hundreds of thousands of asuras equipped with weapons and armor. He headed out to the frontier to make war on the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc766'>SC 766</a>“The Nāga Kings Nanda and Upananda coiled their bodies around Mount Sumeru seven times and shook the mountains and valleys. Fine clouds spread out and released a misting rain. They smacked the ocean’s surface with their tails, which stirred up waves that reached the summit of Mount Sumeru.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc767'>SC 767</a>“The Trāyastriṃśa gods then had this thought, ‘Now, these fine clouds have spread out and released a misting rain … stirred up waves that reach up to here.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc768'>SC 768</a>“An army of countless millions of nāga warriors were in the ocean, too. They were armed with lances, bows and arrows, and swords, and they wore heavy treasure armor. Being well equipped with such weapons, they opposed the asuras and fought them. Sometimes the host of nāgas were victorious and chased the asuras back to their palace. Sometimes the host of nāgas retreated, and the nāgas couldn’t return to their palace. Instead, they would run to the Karoṭapāṇi yakṣa spirits and tell them, ‘The host of asuras are about to attack the gods. We tried to oppose them, but they just defeated us. You should arm yourselves, muster your strength, and go to battle with them!’</p>

Instead, they would run to the realm of the Mālādhāra yakṣa spirits and tell them, ‘The host of asuras are about to attack the gods. We tried to oppose them, but they just defeated us.
