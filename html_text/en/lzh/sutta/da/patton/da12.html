<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>:  One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large group of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give all of you a discourse on the sublime teaching, the content and expression of which is pure and perfects the religious life.

I’m the Tathāgata; I’ve provided all that I should for you. Taking pity on you, I’ve lectured on the sutras and the path. You should also take pity on yourselves and go to a quiet place under a tree or in an empty dwelling to contemplate. Don’t be negligent. Nothing’s gained by not exerting yourselves today and regretting it later.”</p>
