<h2>Chapter 12: The Origins of the World</h2>
<h3>The Repopulation of the World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc811'>SC 811</a>The Buddha told the monks, “After the catastrophe of fire has passed and the earth and heavens of this world are about to reform, the remaining sentient beings’ merits, actions, and lives come to an end. At the end of their lives in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they are born into an empty Brahma abode. Their minds are stained by attachment to the place. Delighted by that abode, they wish other sentient beings would be born there with them. After they make that wish, the merits, actions, and lives of other sentient beings come to an end. When their bodies break up and their lives end in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they’re born in that empty Brahma abode.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc812'>SC 812</a>“The first being born in the Brahma Heaven thinks to himself, ‘I am the Brahma King, the Great Brahma Heaven King! I have no creator, I’ve spontaneously come to be, and I’m subject to no one. I’m the highest sovereign of a thousand worlds, skilled in various meanings, my wealth is bountiful, and I’m the creator of all things. I’m both father and mother to all sentient beings.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc813'>SC 813</a>“After that, the Brahma gods who arrive after him also think, ‘He’s the first Brahma god, the Brahma King, the Great Brahma Heaven King. He spontaneously came to be, and he’s subject to no one. He’s the highest sovereign of a thousand worlds, skilled in various meanings, his wealth is bountiful, and he’s the creator of all things. He’s both father and mother to all sentient beings. We’ve come to exist from him.’ That Brahma Heaven King looked handsome and young, always like a youth. Therefore, that Brahma god was named Kumāra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc814'>SC 814</a>“At a certain point, this world is restored again. The sentient beings that were born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven are numerous. Born here spontaneously, they’re nourished by joy. Their bodies glow with their own light, and they have the miraculous ability to fly. Their happiness has no obstacle, and their life spans are very long.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc815'>SC 815</a>“After that, the world forms a great body of water that fills up every place. The world then is under a great darkness. There’s no sun, moon, stars, nor day and night. There’s no way to count the years, months, or the four seasons.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc816'>SC 816</a>“Some time after that, the world again changes. The merits, actions, and lives of more sentient beings in the Ābhāsvara Heaven come to an end, and they are born here when their lives end. All are born here spontaneously, and they are nourished by joy. Their bodies glow with their own light, and they have the miraculous ability to fly. Their happiness has no obstacles, and their life spans are very long.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc817'>SC 817</a>“In that time, there’s no male or female, noble or ignoble, high or low, or beings with different names. That host is born together in the world, so they are called ‘host born.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc818'>SC 818</a>“At that point, the Earth has a spontaneously produced flavor of earth, which solidifies into earth that’s like ghee. When that flavor of earth is produced, it’s likewise. It’s like butter that tastes as sweet as honey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc819'>SC 819</a>“After that, the sentient beings use their hands to taste what flavor it has. With the first taste, they realize they like it, and then they become attached to tasting it. Thus, they each take turns tasting it without stopping, and then they go after it greedily. They scoop it up with their hands and form it into lumps to eat, and they don’t stop eating it. Other sentient beings see this and emulate them, eating it and not stopping.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc820'>SC 820</a>“The bodies of these sentient beings become rough, and their glow gradually disappears. They no longer have the miraculous ability to fly, either. At that point, there has yet to be a sun or moon, so when the glow of the sentient beings goes out, the world is plunged into a darkness that’s no different than before.</p>
<h3>The Sun</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc821'>SC 821</a>“A long, long time after that, a windstorm blows on the ocean’s water, which is 84,000 yojanas deep. It divides into two whirlwinds that grab the palace hall of the sun and place it half as high as Mount Sumeru, where it takes up the sun’s orbit. It rises in the east and sets in the west, revolving around the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc822'>SC 822</a>“When a second sun palace rises in the east and sets in the west, the sentient beings there say, ‘This must be the sun from yesterday.’</p>
<p>“Others say, ‘It’s not the one from yesterday.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc823'>SC 823</a>“A third sun palace circles Mount Sumeru, rising in the east and setting in the west. Then, the sentient beings say, ‘That’s definitely the same sun.’ The word ‘sun’ means the first cause of illumination; therefore, it’s called the sun. ‘Sun’ also has two meanings. The first is to abide at a constant frequency, and the second is a palace hall.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc824'>SC 824</a>“The palace hall’s four sides are round because they’re seen from far away. It’s made of heavenly gold mixed with crystal that’s neither cold nor hot. Two-thirds of it is pure and unadulterated heavenly gold, inside and out, and its light shines far away. A third of it is pure and unadulterated crystal, inside and out, and its light shines far away. The sun palace is fifty-one yojanas across, and the palace walls are made of a mineral that’s as light as oak or pine wood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc825'>SC 825</a>“That palace has seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, seven treasure bells, and seven rows of trees encircling it with decorations made of the seven treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc826'>SC 826</a>“The gold walls have silver gates, and the silver walls have gold gates. The beryl walls have crystal gates, and the crystal walls have beryl gates. The ruby walls have emerald gates, and the emerald walls have ruby gates. The coral walls have gates made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc827'>SC 827</a>“Those balustrades have gold balusters and silver rails, silver balusters and gold rails, crystal balusters and beryl rails, beryl balusters and crystal rails, ruby balusters and emerald rails, emerald balusters and ruby rails, and coral balusters with rails made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc828'>SC 828</a>“The gold nettings have silver bells, and the silver nettings have gold bells. The beryl nettings have crystal bells, and the crystal nettings have beryl bells. The ruby nettings have emerald bells, and the emerald nettings have ruby bells. The coral nettings have bells made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc829'>SC 829</a>“The gold trees have silver leaves, flowers, and fruit. The silver trees have gold leaves, flowers, and fruit. The beryl trees have crystal <span class='add'>leaves</span>, flowers, and fruit. The crystal trees have beryl <span class='add'>leaves</span>, flowers, and fruit. The ruby trees have emerald <span class='add'>leaves</span>, flowers, and fruit. The emerald trees have ruby <span class='add'>leaves</span>, flowers, and fruit. The coral trees have <span class='add'>leaves</span>, flowers, and fruit made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc830'>SC 830</a>“The palace walls have four gates. The gates have seven stair steps, and they’re encircled by balustrades, towers, terraces, forest parks, and lakes alongside each other in that order. Myriad treasure flowers grow in rows along with a variety of fruit trees with flowers and leaves of assorted colors. The fragrance of the trees is sweet-smelling and spreads far away in all directions. Flocks of various birds sing to each other peacefully.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc831'>SC 831</a>“There are five winds that hold the sun palace up. First is the holding wind, second is the sustaining wind, third is the receiving wind, fourth is the turning wind, and fifth is the controlling wind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc832'>SC 832</a>“The sun god stands in his correct hall, which is made of pure gold and sixteen yojanas tall. The hall has four doors with balustrades encircling it. The sun god’s throne is a half yojana across, made of the seven treasures, and pure and soft as heavenly cloth. The sun god’s own body emits light that shines on his golden hall. The golden hall’s light then shines on the sun palace, and the sun palace’s light shines on the four continents.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc833'>SC 833</a>“The sun god lives for 500 heavenly years, and his descendants who succeed him are no different. His palace is indestructible until it ends after one eon.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc834'>SC 834</a>“As the sun palace moves, the sun god has no notion of that motion. He says, ‘Walking or standing still, I’m always enjoying myself with the five desires.’ As the sun palace moves, countless hundreds of thousands of great gods and spirits are ahead of it leading the way. They do so gladly without tiring of it, being delighted by its speed. This is the reason the sun god is named ‘Quickness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc835'>SC 835</a>“The sun god’s body emits 1,000 rays of light. 500 rays shine downwards and 500 rays shine horizontally. As a result of the virtue of his past deeds, he has 1,000 rays of light. Therefore, the sun god is called ‘1,000 Rays of Light.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc836'>SC 836</a>“What are the virtues of his past deeds? Sometimes, a person gives offerings to ascetics and priests and gives aid to the poor. He gives gifts of meals, clothing, medicine, horses and elephants, vehicles, housing, lamps, and candles. When he distributes such things, he does so according to what’s needed and doesn’t go contrary to people’s wishes. He supports noble people who observe the precepts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc837'>SC 837</a>“As a result these diverse and countless causes of Dharma joy and light, his heart is good, and he’s joyful. He’s like a water-anointed king who has just ascended to the throne. His heart is good, and he’s joyful in the same way. When his body breaks up and his life ends, he becomes the sun god and attains the sun palace hall because of these circumstances. Because he possesses 1,000 rays of light, these are said to be the good deeds that obtain 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc838'>SC 838</a>“Again, what’s called the past deeds of light? Some people don’t kill beings, don’t steal, don’t engage in sexual misconduct, don’t speak duplicitously, harshly, falsely, or frivolously, aren’t greedy or hateful, and don’t have wrong views. Because of these circumstances, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. It’s like a major crossroads with a large bathing pool that’s clear and unpolluted. People traveling from far away are exhausted, hot, and thirsty when they arrive at the pool. They go in to bathe and refresh themselves, rejoicing and delighting in it. Those ten good deeds make their hearts good, and they’re joyful in the same way. When such people’s bodies break up and their lives end, they become the sun god. Dwelling in the sun palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light. For these reasons, <span class='add'>these deeds</span> are called good deeds of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc839'>SC 839</a>“Again, what is the reason for called them ‘<span class='add'>good deeds of</span> 1,000 rays of light’? Some people don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t engage in sex, don’t lie, and don’t drink alcohol. Because of these causes, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. When their bodies break up and their lives end, they become the sun god. Dwelling in the sun palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light. For these reasons, they are called the good deeds of 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc840'>SC 840</a>“Sixty kṣaṇas are called a lava. Thirty lavas are called a muhūrta. A hundred muhūrtas are called an upamā. The sun palace moves south for six months. The sun moves fifteen kilometers to the south, not going beyond Jambudvīpa. The sun travels north in the same way.</p>
<h3>Ten Reasons Sunlight Is Hot</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc841'>SC 841</a>“What are the reasons for sunlight to be hot? There are ten causes for this. What are the ten? First, Mount Khadiraka outside of Mount Sumeru is 42,000 yojanas tall and 42,000 yojanas across. Its bounds are measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is one reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc842'>SC 842</a>“Second, Mount Īśādāra outside of Mount Khadiraka is 21,000 yojanas tall and 21,000 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the second reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc843'>SC 843</a>“Third, Mount Yugandhara outside of Mount Īśādāra is 12,000 yojanas tall and 12,000 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the third reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc844'>SC 844</a>“Fourth, Mount Sudarśana outside of Mount Yugandhara is 6,000 yojanas tall and 6,000 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the fourth reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc845'>SC 845</a>“Fifth, Mount Aśvakarṇa outside of Mount Sudarśana is 3,000 yojanas tall and 3,000 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the fifth reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc846'>SC 846</a>“Sixth, Mount Nimindhara outside of Mount Aśvakarṇa is 1,200 yojanas tall and 1,200 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the sixth reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc847'>SC 847</a>“Seventh, Mount Vinitaka outside of Mount Nimindhara is 600 yojanas tall and 600 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the seventh reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc848'>SC 848</a>“Eighth, Mount Cakravāḍa outside of Mount Vinitaka is 300 yojanas tall and 300 yojanas across. Its circumference is measureless, and it’s made of the seven treasures. The sun’s light shines on that mountain, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the seventh reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc849'>SC 849</a>“Furthermore, 10,000 yojanas above, there’s a heavenly palace called the stellar constellations that’s made of crystal. The sun’s light shines on that palace, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the ninth reason for sunlight to be hot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc850'>SC 850</a>“Furthermore, the sun palace’s light shines on the earth, and it creates heat when they come into contact. This is the tenth reason for sunlight to be hot.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc851'>SC 851</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “For these ten reasons,<br>
The sun is called a thousand lights.<br>
It’s light is fiery and hot,<br>
As described by the Buddha sun.”</p>

<h3>Thirteen Reasons for Cold Weather in Sunlight</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc852'>SC 852</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Why is the sun palace cold and distant during winter, and the weather is freezing even with light? There are thirteen reasons that it’s freezing even with light. What are the thirteen? First, there’s a lake between Mount Sumeru and Mount Khadiraka that’s 84,000 yojanas wide. Its circumference is measureless, and various flowers grow in its water, such as utpala, kumuda, padma, puṇḍarīka, and sugandha flowers. When the sun’s light shines on it, it becomes cold on contact. This is the first reason for sunlight to be cold.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc853'>SC 853</a>“Second, there’s a lake between Mount Khadiraka and Mount Īśādāra that’s 42,000 yojanas wide.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc860'>SC 860</a>“Furthermore, the sun’s light shines on the ocean, rivers, and streams here in Jambudvīpa, and it becomes cold on contact. This is the ninth reason for sunlight to be cold.</p>

<h3>The Moon</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc866'>SC 866</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are times when the moon palace’s round form waxes and wanes, and its light decreases and disappears. Therefore, the moon palace is named for its reduction. ‘Moon’ has two meanings. The first is to abide in eternal liberation. The second is the palace hall.</p>

For these reasons, they are called the good deeds of 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc878'>SC 878</a>“Sixty kṣaṇas are called a lava. Thirty lavas are called a muhūrta. A hundred muhūrtas are called an upamā. The sun palace moves south for six months. The sun moves fifteen kilometers to the south, not going beyond Jambudvīpa. The moon palace then moves south for half a year, not going beyond Jambudvīpa. The moon travels north in the same way.</p>
<h3>The Waxing and Waning of the Moon</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc879'>SC 879</a>“What’s the reason the moon palace gradually decreases and disappears? There are three causes for the moon palace to decrease and disappear. First is when the moon rises diagonally. This is the first reason the moon decreases and disappears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc880'>SC 880</a>“Furthermore, the great ministers put on blue robes inside the moon palace. Where they stand becomes blue, so the moon decreases. This is the second reason the moon disappears day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc881'>SC 881</a>“Furthermore, the sun palace has sixty rays of light that shine on the moon palace. They outshine it, which makes it disappear. As parts of the moon are dimmed, it decreases and disappears. This is the third reason the moon’s light decreases and disappears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc882'>SC 882</a>“Again, what’s the reason the moon’s light gradually becomes full? There are three causes that make the moon’s light gradually become full. What are the three? First, the moon’s facing is a perfect square, so the moon’s light becomes full.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc883'>SC 883</a>“Second, the moon palace’s ministers take off their blue robes. The moon god sits in his place on the fifteenth day to entertain himself. His light then shines everywhere and blocks the light of the heavens, so it’s light is completely full. It’s just as when the flame of a large torch among lit lamps blocks the light of the lamps. That moon god is likewise. On the fifteenth day, the myriad lights of the host of gods are blocked. The moon’s light is the only one that shines in the same way. This is the second reason.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc884'>SC 884</a>“Third, although the sun god has sixty rays of light that shine on the moon palace, the moon god is able to counteract them on the fifteenth day so that the moon’s light isn’t obscured. This is the third cause for the moon palace to become completely full without any decrease.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc885'>SC 885</a>“Again, what’s the reason for a dark shadow to be on the moon? When the moon is in the shadow of the Jambu tree, that causes the moon to have a shadow on it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc886'>SC 886</a>The Buddha told the monks, “One’s mind should be like the moon, clear and unheated. When going to a donor’s home, be mindful and unconfused.</p>
<h3>Other Features of the World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc887'>SC 887</a>“Again, what’s reason for the great rivers to exist? It’s because the sun and moon have heat. That heat causes hot <span class='add'>weather</span>. Hot weather causes sweating. The sweat forms large rivers, so the world has great rivers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc888'>SC 888</a>“What’s the reason for the world’s five types of seed? There are great windstorms that don’t destroy the world. They blows seeds into the world, and they grow in the lands here. The first are root seeds, second are stem seeds, third are joint seeds, fourth are the hollow seeds, and fifth are embryonic seeds. These are the five seeds. For this reason, five types of seed arise in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc889'>SC 889</a>“At noon here in Jambudvīpa, the sun is setting in Pūrvavideha, the sun is rising in Godānīya, and it’s midnight in Uttarakuru. At noon in Godānīya, the sun is setting in Jambudvīpa, the sun is rising in Uttarakuru, and it’s midnight in Pūrvavideha. At noon in Uttarakuru, the sun is setting in Godānīya, the sun is rising in Pūrvavideha, and it’s midnight in Jambudvīpa. At noon in Pūrvavideha, the sun is setting in Uttarakuru, the sun is rising in Jambudvīpa, and it’s midnight in Godānīya.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc890'>SC 890</a>“What’s east in Jambudvīpa is west in Pūrvavideha. What’s west in Jambudvīpa is east in Godānīya. What’s west in Godānīya is east in Uttarakuru. What’s west in Uttarakuru is east in Pūrvavideha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc891'>SC 891</a>“Jambudvīpa is named after the Jambu <span class='add'>tree</span>. Under it, there’s a mountain of gold that’s 30 yojanas tall and causes the Jambu tree to grow, so it’s called Jambu’s gold. The Jambu tree has fruit that resembles mushrooms and tastes as sweet as honey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc892'>SC 892</a>“That tree has five large corners. On it’s four sides are four corners, and one corner is above it. Gandharvas eat the fruit on the east corner. People from the seven countries eat the fruit on the south corner. The first country is Kuru,  the second is Koravya (?), third is Videha, fourth is Suvideha (?), fifth is Manda (?), sixth is Bārāṇasī, and seventh is Parikhā (?). Sea serpents eat the fruit on the west corner. Animals eat the fruit on the  north corner. Gods of the stellar constellations eat the fruit from the top corner.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc893'>SC 893</a>“North of the seven great countries, there are seven great black mountains. The first is Bare Land, second is White Stork, third is Palace Protector, fourth is Sage Mountain, fifth is High Mountain, sixth is Dhyāna Mountain, and seventh is Land Mountain. On these seven black mountains, there are seven priestly sages. These seven sages who live on them are named Good Lord, Good Light, Palace Protector, Sage, Palace Defender, Gaṇana, and Increase.”</p>
<h3>The Devolution of Sentient Beings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc894'>SC 894</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The first sentient beings of the eon eat the flavor of the earth, and they live in the world for a long time. Those that often eat it become cruder in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I am superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they maintain grudges, the earth flavor dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc895'>SC 895</a>“Next, the earth grows a skin shaped like thin rice cakes, and it’s color, flavor, and aroma is pure. At that point, the sentient beings gather in one place and feel miserable, lament, and beat their breasts. They say, ‘Oh, what a disaster! The flavor of the earth is nowhere to be found now!’ It’s like present-day people who discover a rich and delicious flavor, and they praise it as delicious and good. Later, they miss it and are saddened. Those sentient beings are likewise, feeling miserable and regretful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc896'>SC 896</a>“After they eat the earth skin, they slowly get its flavor. Those that often eat it become cruder in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I’m superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they harbor grudges, the earth skin dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc897'>SC 897</a>“After that, another earth skin is produced that’s even cruder. It has the color of heavenly flowers, it’s as soft as heavenly cloth, and its flavor is like honey. The sentient beings again take and eat it, and they live in the world for a long time. Those that often eat it become degraded in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I’m superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they harbor grudges, the earth skin dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc898'>SC 898</a>“After that, there’s spontaneous rice that lacks any chaff or husks, doesn’t need to be seasoned, and possesses many delicious flavors. At that point, the sentient beings gather and say, ‘Oh, what a disaster! The earth skin is nowhere to be found now!’ They are like present-day people who encounter some unfortunate difficulty and exclaim, ‘What a pain!’ Those sentient beings likewise feel miserable and sigh.</p>
<h3>Families and Homes Arise</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc899'>SC 899</a>“After that, the sentient beings take the rice and eat it, and their bodies become uglier, having male and female forms. They look at each other and chase after notions of desire. They go to private places together and do impure things. Other sentient beings that see them say, ‘Oh, this is wrong! How can those sentient beings go and do such things together?’ They go to the impure males and rebuke them, telling them to repent their mistake. ‘What you did was wrong!’ Then, they throw them to the ground.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc900'>SC 900</a>“When the female sees that male thrown to the ground, their repentance doesn’t happen. Instead, the woman brings him food. Other sentient beings that see this ask the woman, ‘Who are you going to give that food you’re carrying?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc901'>SC 901</a>“The woman answers, ‘That repentant sentient being who fell into unwholesome conduct. I’m bringing this food to him.’ Because she says this, the name ‘unwholesome master’ comes to be in the world. Because she brings this food to that man, the name ‘wife’ comes to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc902'>SC 902</a>“After that, sentient beings pursue their lust indulgently and unskillful qualities increase. In order to conceal themselves, they build houses. As a result of this, the term ‘home’ comes to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc903'>SC 903</a>“After that, sentient beings increasingly indulge in lust, and they seek to become husband and wife. The life span, conduct, and merits of other sentient beings in the Ābhāsvara Heaven come to an end. When their lives end, they’re reborn here in a mother’s womb. As a result, the term ‘womb’ comes to exist in the world.</p>
<h3>Cities Are Built and Property Is Invented</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc904'>SC 904</a>“At that point, the city of Campā is built. Next, the city of Kāśi is built, and then the city of Rājagṛha is built. They begin building them when the sun rises and complete them when the sun rises. As a result, the world has the names of large cities and districts that are governed by kings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc905'>SC 905</a>“Sentient beings begin eating the spontaneous rice. When they gather it in the morning, it’s ripe again by evening. When they gather it in the evening, and it’s ripen again by morning. After they gather it, the rice grows back again without stems or stalks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc906'>SC 906</a>“Some sentient beings then silently think to themselves, ‘I gather this rice every day. It’s tiresome for me to do that. Now, I’ll gather enough to supply myself for several days.’ Then, when they gather the rice, they accumulate enough for several days.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc907'>SC 907</a>“Later, someone else asks that person, ‘Do you want to go gather rice together?’</p>
<p>“They reply, ‘I’ve already stockpiled it, so I don’t need to gather more. If you want to collect it, go do as you like.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc908'>SC 908</a>“Afterward, that person thinks, ‘I gathered two days of rice before. Why not gather three days of rice?’ They then accumulate three days’ worth of rice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc909'>SC 909</a>“Again, someone else says, ‘Let’s go gather rice together!’</p>
<p>“They reply, ‘I’ve already gathered three days’ worth of rice. If you want to gather rice, do as you like.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc910'>SC 910</a>“The other person then thinks, ‘That man can gather three days’ worth of rice. Why couldn’t I gather five days’ worth of rice?’ Afterward, they gather five days’ worth of rice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc911'>SC 911</a>“Because of these sentient beings competing to accumulate rice, the rice begins to grow chaff and husks, and it doesn’t grow back after being gathered anymore. Instead, it turns to withered stalks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc912'>SC 912</a>“At that point, the sentient beings gathered in one place and felt miserable, lamenting and beating their breasts. They said, ‘Oh, what a disaster!’ They reproach themselves, saying, ‘Originally, we were born spontaneously and were nourished with thought. Our bodies glowed with their own light, and we had the miraculous ability of flight. Our happiness had no obstacles.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc913'>SC 913</a>“‘After that, the flavor of the earth first arose, which was perfect in color and flavor. We ate this flavor of the earth, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>notions</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior! Your form isn’t equal to mine!” We fought because of arrogance about our forms, and the flavor of the earth disappeared.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc914'>SC 914</a>“‘Then, the earth skin grew, and it’s form, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Once again, we took it and ate, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate it were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>notions</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior! Your form isn’t equal to mine!” We fought because of arrogance about our forms, and the earth skin disappeared.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc915'>SC 915</a>“‘Then, the earth crust grew, becoming a cruder substance, but it’s color, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Once again, we took it and ate, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate it were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>notions</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior!

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc916'>SC 916</a>“‘Then, spontaneous rice grew, and it’s color, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Again, we took and ate it. When we gathered it in the morning, it was ripe again by evening. When we gathered it in the evening, and it was ripe again by morning. We would gather it, and it would grow back when we didn’t store what we gathered. It grew chaff and husks when we competed with each other’s stockpiles, and then it didn’t grow back when we gathered it. It turned to withered stalks. Now, we ought to assign fields to houses and make boundaries between the fields.’ They then divide the land into different demarcated fields and assign them to others and themselves.</p>
<h3>Law and Crime Are Invented</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc917'>SC 917</a>“After that, one of them proceeds to store their own rice and steal from other’s fields. When other sentient beings see this, they say, ‘You are a wrongdoer! You are a wrongdoer! Why are you stealing other’s property when you have your own stores and things?’ Then they rebuke them, ‘Don’t ever do that again!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc918'>SC 918</a>“Still, that person doesn’t stop stealing. The other people again rebuke them, ‘You were doing wrong! Why didn’t you stop?’ They then hit the thief with their hand, lead them to an assembly, and tell the assembled people, ‘This person has their own store of rice and stole from another’s field.’</p>
<p>“The thief also says, ‘They hit me!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc919'>SC 919</a>“When they see this happen, the assembled people are saddened and cry. They beat their breasts and say, ‘The world has become evil! How did this evil come about?’ The bonds of sorrow and distress arise, resulting in pain. This is the origin of birth, old age, illness, and death as well as falling to bad destinies. As a result of farmland being divided with boundaries, this fighting happens. No one can decide what brought about these resentments and reprisals. ‘Now, we should designate one equitable chief to safeguard the people, reward those who are good, and punish those who are evil. Our assembly will provide for him to reduce the harm to all of us.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc920'>SC 920</a>“A man was then selected from that assembly who was physically large, handsome in appearance, and imposing in authority. He said to the people, ‘Now, you’ve made me chief to safeguard the people, reward those who are good, and punish those who are evil. You’ve provided for this to reduce the harm to everyone.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc921'>SC 921</a>“Those people listened to him and accepted him as their chief who would reward what should be rewarded and punish what should be punished. It’s then that the name ‘chief of the people’ first comes to be.</p>
<h3>The Lineages of Kings</h3>

The people all praised his goodness, ‘This man was able to renounce the ties to home, go to the mountains, and pursue the path.

As a result, the name ‘poison’ came into being. As a result of these causes, the world came to have the priestly caste.</p>
