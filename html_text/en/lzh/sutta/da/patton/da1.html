  <h1>The Great Legend</h1>
</header>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was at the Flowering Grove Hut in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the monks gathered in the Flowering Grove Hall after soliciting alms. They engaged in a discussion with each other: “Venerable monks, only the unsurpassed sage is so extraordinary! His miraculous powers are far-reaching, and his authority is tremendous. He has come to know the countless buddhas of the past who have entered nirvāṇa, broken the bonds, and eliminated idle speculation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“He also knows how many eons ago those buddhas lived as well as their names, surnames, the clans to which they were born, the meals they had, the length of their lives, and what suffering and happiness they experienced.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“He also knows that those buddhas possessed such precepts, such principles, such wisdom, such liberation, and such abodes.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“What do you think, gentlemen? Does the Tathāgata know this by discerning well the nature of things, or does he know these things because the gods come and tell him about them?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and clearly overheard the monks having that discussion with his heavenly ear. He rose from his seat, went to the Flowering Grove Hall, prepared a seat, and sat down.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>He knew the answer, but the Bhagavān still asked them, “Monks, what have you been discussing after gathering here?” The monks then related to him what it had been.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>The Bhagavān told the monks, “Good, good! With correct faith, you’ve left home to cultivate the path, and you practice as you should. All of you have two types of conduct: The first is noble discussion of the teaching, and the second is noble silence. This discussion of yours is as it should be: ‘The Tathāgata’s miraculous powers <span class='add'>[are far-reaching,]</span> and his authority are tremendous. He fully knows the events of countless eons in the past. He knows it because he understands well the nature of things and because the gods come and tell him.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The Buddha then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Monks gathered in the Dharma hall<br>
And held a noble discussion;<br>
In a quiet place, the Tathāgata<br>
Heard it all with his heavenly ear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The Buddha sun’s light shines everywhere<br>
As he discerns the Dharma realm’s meaning.<br>
He also knows the past events of<br>
The Completely Awakened and their nirvāṇa.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Their names, surnames, and families,<br>
The births they received, I know, too.<br>
The places where they had lived,<br>
I recall them with clear vision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Those gods of great authority,<br>
Quite dignified in appearance,<br>
Also come and tell me about<br>
The Completely Awakened and their nirvāṇa.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Recounting their births, names, and surnames,<br>
Their <em>kalaviṅka</em> voices fully knew them.<br>
To the Unsurpassed Sage of Gods and Humans,<br>
They describe the buddhas of the past.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Seven Buddhas</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>He again asked the monks, “Would you like to hear about the circumstances of past buddhas that the Tathāgata knows with the knowledge of past lives? I’ll tell you about them.”</p>
<p>The monks said, “Bhagavān, now would be a good time for it.” “We’d be glad to hear it.” “Excellent, Bhagavān!” “If there’s time for a discourse, we’ll approve of it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I’ll discern and explain it for you.” The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Ninety-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Vipaśyin who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was a buddha named Śikhin who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, thirty-one eons ago, there was another buddha named Viśvabhū who was the Tathāgata, the Arhat, that arose in the world. Furthermore, monks, during this present eon of fortune, there was a buddha named Krakucchanda, another who was named Kanakamuni, and another who was named Kāśyapa. Now, I’ve also achieved the supreme and complete awakening during this present eon of fortune.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>The Buddha then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Ninety-one eons in the past,<br>
There was the Buddha Vipaśyin.<br>
Next, thirty-one eons ago,<br>
There was the Buddha named Śikhin.<br>
During that same eon,<br>
Tathāgata Viśvabhū arose.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>During the present eon of fortune,<br>
There’ve been countless millions of years.<br>
There were four great sages<br>
Who arose because of their pity for beings:<br>
Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni,<br>
Kāśyapa, and Śākyamuni.</p>

<h3>Their Life Spans</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“You should know that during the time of Buddha Vipaśyin, people lived for 80,000 years.

During the time of Buddha Krakucchanda, people lived for 40,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kanakamuni, people lived for 30,000 years. During the time of Buddha Kāśyapa, people lived for 20,000 years. In the present time that I’ve arisen in the world, few people live more than a hundred years, and many live for less.”</p>

<h3>Their Clans and Surnames</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Buddha Vipaśyin arose from a warrior clan, and his surname was Kauṇḍinya. Buddha Śikhin and Buddha Viśvabhū had the same type of clan and surname. Buddha Krakucchanda arose from a priestly clan, and his surname was Kāśyapa. Buddha Kanakamuni and Buddha Kāśyapa had the same type of clan and surname. Now, I’m a Tathāgata, an Arhat, who arose from a warrior clan, and my surname is Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>The Buddha then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Tathāgatas Vipaśyin,<br>
Śikhin, and Viśvabhū:<br>
These Completely Awakened Ones<br>
Arose from the Kauṇḍinya clan.<br>
The next three Tathāgatas after that<br>
Arose from the Kāśyapa clan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Now, I am the unsurpassed sage,<br>
The trainer of sentient beings,<br>
And supreme among gods and humans<br>
Who’s from the courageous Gautama clan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The first three Completely Awakened Ones<br>
Arose from warrior clans,<br>

<h3>Their Trees of Awakening</h3>

<p>Tathāgata Kāśyapa sat<br>
Under a banyan tree.<br>
He made it his dwelling place<br>
And eradicated the source of all existences.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Now, I’m Śākyamuni<br>
Who sat at a sacred fig tree;<br>
The Tathāgata, the Ten-Powered Sage<br>
Who broke the bonds.<br>
I crushed the army of Māra<br>
And explained great insight to the multitudes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>These seven buddhas with the power of effort<br>
Radiated light and dispelled darkness.<br>
They each sat under trees<br>
Where they achieved the complete awakening.</p>
