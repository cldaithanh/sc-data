<h2>Chapter 1: The Continent of Jambudvīpa</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying in the Karīrika Hut in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park at Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>After their meal, a group of monks gathered up in the meeting hall. They had this discussion: “Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What are the countries where sentient beings live?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and overheard them clearly with his heavenly ear. He heard those monks saying this, having gathering up in the meeting hall after their meal. The Bhagavān then emerged from his quiet hut, went to the meeting hall, and sat down. Knowing it, he purposefully questioned them. He asked the monks, “You were having a discussion earlier. What was it that you were discussing?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The monks said to the Buddha, “We gathered here in the meeting hall after our meal and discussed this: ‘Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What countries do sentient beings live in?’ This was what we were discussing after gathering here in the hall.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Good, good! Everyone who’s left home should practice two things: The first is the noble silence, and the second is <span class='add'>the noble</span> discussion of the Dharma. When all of you gather in a meeting hall, you should practice noble silence or <span class='add'>noble</span> discussion of the Dharma. Monks, would you like to hear the Tathāgata describe the formation and destruction of heaven and earth and the cities and countries where sentient beings live?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān, now would be a good time! We’d be glad to hear it. Once the Bhagavān has explained this, we’ll remember it!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Buddha said, “Monks, listen closely! Listen closely and consider it well! I will explain it for you.”</p>
<h3>The Buddha Realm</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Just as one sun and moon orbit the four continents and shine their light on them, there are a thousand such worlds. In a thousand worlds, there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Sumeru mountain kings, four thousand continents, four thousand great continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand great oceans, four thousand nāgas, four thousand great nāgas, four thousand garuḍas, four thousand great garuḍas, four thousand unpleasant destinies, four thousand great unpleasant destinies, four thousand kings, four thousand great kings, seven thousand great trees, eight thousand great hells, ten thousand great mountains, a thousand King Yamas, a thousand four god kings, a thousand Trāyastriṃśa Heavens, a thousand Yama Heavens, a thousand Tuṣita Heavens, a thousand Nirmāṇarati Heavens, a thousand Paranirmitavaśavartin Heavens, and a thousand Brahma Heavens. This is a small thousand worlds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Like one small thousand worlds, a thousand of those small thousand worlds are a medium thousand worlds. Like one medium thousand worlds, a thousand of those medium thousand worlds are a triple-thousand great thousand worlds. Such worlds revolve around as they form and are destroyed. The sentient beings that inhabit them are called a single Buddha realm.”</p>
<h3>The World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Now, this Earth is 168,000 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless <span class='add'>in the four directions</span>. Where the earth stops, there’s water. The water is 3,030 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Where the water stops, there’s air. The air is 6,040 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Monks, the ocean’s water is 84,000 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Sumeru the mountain king is 84,000 yojanas in the water, and it rises to a height of 84,000 yojanas above the ocean. Below, it’s roots connect it to the earth with many hard points. That mountain goes straight up without any bends. All sorts of trees grow on it, and the trees produce many fragrances. The fragrances pervade the mountain’s forests. Many noble people, great spirits, and marvelous gods make their homes there. The foundation under that mountain is entirely gold sand. Four crags emerge from that mountain’s four sides that are 700 yojanas high with a mixture of colors throughout and made of the seven treasures. Those four crags are slanted, leaning precariously over the ocean.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Sumeru the mountain king has stairways made of the seven treasures. At the bottom, the stairways are sixty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by a seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Each of the seven walls has four gates. The gates have balustrades, and towers and terraces are above the seven walls. They’re surrounded by scenic parks and lakes where myriad precious flowers and plants grow. The rows of treasure trees are full with flowers and fruit, and they produce fragrances that blow in the four directions to the delight of passersby. Ducks, geese, cakras, and other rare kinds of birds in countless thousands sing peacefully to each other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Furthermore, halfway up Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are forty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the lower stairways.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“At the top of Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are twenty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the middle stairways.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are yakṣa spirits that live on the lower stairway called Karoṭapāṇi. The yakṣa spirits that live on the middle stairway are called Mālādhāra. The yakṣa spirits that live on the upper stairway are called Sadāmada.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of “Anavatapta”</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc69'>SC 69</a>The Buddha said, “Why is it called Anavatapta? What’s the meaning of ‘Anavatapta’? Here in Jambudvīpa, there’s a nāga king who stopped having three troubles. Only the nāga Anavatapta has none of these three troubles. What are the three?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc70'>SC 70</a>“First, all the nāgas throughout Jambudvīpa suffer from hot winds and hot sand that cling to their bodies and burn their skin and flesh. It even burns their bones and marrow, causing them misery. Only the nāga Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc71'>SC 71</a>“Second, all the nāga palaces throughout Jambudvīpa have fierce winds that blow through them. They lose their treasure-decorated clothes, and their nāga bodies are left exposed, which causes them misery. Only the Nāga King Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc72'>SC 72</a>“Third, when all the nāga kings throughout Jambudvīpa entertain themselves in their respective palaces, great garuḍa birds take the opportunity to snatch them or their newly born, for they like to eat nāgas. The nāgas are afraid of them and always feel distressed about this. Only the nāga Anavatapta doesn’t have this trouble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc73'>SC 73</a>If the garuḍa birds decide to go there, their lives end. Therefore, it’s called Anavatapta (Anavatapta in Chinese means ‘No Distress’).”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc74'>SC 74</a>The Buddha told the monks, “On the right side of Mount Himavat, there’s a city named Vaiśālī. That city has seven black mountains to its north. North of those seven black mountains, there’s a fragrance mountain. There are always sounds of music and singing at that mountain. It has two caves: One is called Painted and the second is called Skillfully Painted. They’re made of seven heavenly treasures that are soft and pleasant smelling like heavenly cloth. The Gandharva King Sarasvatī lives there with 500 gandharvas.</p>
<h3>The Elephant King Susaṃsthita</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc75'>SC 75</a>“North of the caves Painted and Skillfully Painted is a sal tree king named Susaṃsthita. It’s surrounded on four sides by 8,000 other tree kings. An elephant king lives under the tree king Susaṃsthita that’s also named Susaṃsthita. His body is all white, he stands flush in seven places, and he has the ability to fly. His head is red and his hair is multicolored. His six tusks are delicate, and there’s gold between them. He’s surrounded by 8,000 elephants that follow him. Those 8,000 elephants live under the 8,000 other tree kings in the same way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc76'>SC 76</a>“North of that tree king Susaṃsthita is a large lake named Mandākinī. It’s fifty yojanas across, surrounded all around by 8,000 ponds, and its water is refreshing and unpolluted. It’s surrounded by an embankment made of bricks of the seven treasures, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees that are made of the seven treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc77'>SC 77</a>“<span class='add'>The balustrades</span> have gold balusters with silver rails, silver balusters with gold rails, crystal balusters with beryl rails, beryl balusters with crystal rails, ruby balusters with emerald rails, emerald balusters with ruby rails, and coral balusters with rails made of many treasures.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc80'>SC 80</a>“The bottom of that lake is strewn with gold sand, and it has stairways made of seven treasures all around it. The gold stairs have silver steps, the silver stairs have gold steps, the beryl stairs have crystal steps, the crystal stairs have beryl steps, the ruby stairs have emerald steps, the emerald stairs have ruby steps, and the coral stairs have steps made of many treasures. There are also precious balustrades on both sides of those stairs.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc81'>SC 81</a>“The four kinds of flowers grow in that lake with a mixture of blues, yellows, reds, and whites. The flowers are like cartwheels and their roots are like wheel hubs. The roots of those flowers produce sap that’s white as milk and tastes sweet as honey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc82'>SC 82</a>“There are many scenic parks, forests, and ponds on all four sides of that lake where various refreshing flowers and trees grow. Their flowers and fruit are bountiful, and countless birds sing to each other peacefully as before.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc83'>SC 83</a>“When the elephant king Susaṃsthita decides to entertain himself in the lake, he thinks of the other 8,000 elephant kings. Those 8,000 elephant kings then think to themselves, ‘The elephant king Susaṃsthita is thinking of us now! We ought to pay the elephant king a visit.’ Then the herd of elephants go before him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc84'>SC 84</a>“The elephant king Susaṃsthita then goes to Lake Mandākinī with the other 8,000 elephants. Some among those elephants carry parasols and hold precious fans for the elephant king. Some among them dance and play music in front of them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc85'>SC 85</a>“When the elephant king Susaṃsthita enters the lake to bathe, they dance and play music to entertain each other. Some of the elephants wash the king’s trunk, some wash his mouth, some wash his head, some wash his tusks, some wash his ears, some wash his stomach, some wash his back, some wash his tail, and some wash his feet. Some of them pick flowers and roots, wash them, and give them to the king to eat. Some of them throw the four kinds of flowers on the king.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc86'>SC 86</a>“After he has bathed, drank, eaten, and entertained himself, the elephant king Susaṃsthita goes onto the shore and stands facing the tree Susaṃsthita. Afterward, the other 8,000 elephants each go into the lake to bathe, drink, eat, and entertain themselves. When they’re finished, they come back out and go to the elephant king.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc87'>SC 87</a>“The elephant king then leads the other 8,000 elephants to the tree king Susaṃsthita. Some among them carry parasols for the elephant king. Some bear precious fans to fan the elephant king, and some among them dance and play music in front of the others.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc88'>SC 88</a>“When the elephant king Susaṃsthita reaches the tree king, he sits, lies down, or walks around as he likes. The other 8,000 elephants each are free to sit, lie down, and walk around as they like.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc89'>SC 89</a>“In that tree’s forest, there’s a circle <span class='add'>of trees</span> eight fathoms in size, a circle nine fathoms in size … ten fathoms … fifteen fathoms in size. Only the elephant king Susaṃsthita was within a circle sixteen fathoms in size around the sal tree king. When those other 8,000 sal trees drop their limbs and leaves, a cool breeze blows through the forest from outside. Also, when the other 8,000 elephants defecate and urinate, yakṣas remove it from the forest.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc90'>SC 90</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The elephant king Susaṃsthita possesses great miraculous abilities. Such is his virtue. Although he was born an animal, he received such fortune.”</p>
