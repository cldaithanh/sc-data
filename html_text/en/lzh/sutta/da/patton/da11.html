  <h1>Increasing One by One</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give you a discourse on the sublime teaching in which all the words in the beginning, middle, and end are true, the content and expression are pure, and the religious life is perfected. It’s called the teaching that increases one by one. All of you, listen closely and consider it well! I will teach it for you.”</p>
<p>The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.</p>
<h3>The Ones</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha told the monks, “This is the teaching that increases one by one: There’s one thing to be achieved, one thing to be cultivated, one thing to be recognized, one thing to be ceased, and one thing to be realized.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“Also, he observes the arising and ceasing nature of the five acquired aggregates: ‘This is form, form’s coming together, and form’s cessation. This is feeling … conception … volition … consciousness, consciousness’s coming together, and consciousness’s cessation.’ This is the eighth cause and condition that gains knowledge before the religious life is attained and that increases knowledge once it has been attained.</p>

Going beyond the abode of space and abiding in the abode of consciousness is the fifth liberation. Going beyond the abode of consciousness and abiding in the abode of nothingness is the sixth liberation.
