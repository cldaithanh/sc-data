<h2>Chapter 1: The Continent of Jambudvīpa</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying in the Karīrika Hut in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park at Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>After their meal, a group of monks gathered up in the meeting hall. They had this discussion: “Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What are the countries where sentient beings live?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān was in a quiet place at the time and overheard them clearly with his heavenly ear. He heard those monks saying this, having gathering up in the meeting hall after their meal. The Bhagavān then emerged from his quiet hut, went to the meeting hall, and sat down. Knowing it, he purposefully questioned them. He asked the monks, “You were having a discussion earlier. What was it that you were discussing?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The monks said to the Buddha, “We gathered here in the meeting hall after our meal and discussed this: ‘Gentlemen, it’s amazing! What causes the destruction of heaven and earth? What causes their formation? What countries do sentient beings live in?’ This was what we were discussing after gathering here in the hall.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Good, good! Everyone who’s left home should practice two things: The first is the noble silence, and the second is <span class='add'>[the noble]</span> discussion of the Dharma. When all of you gather in a meeting hall, you should practice noble silence or <span class='add'>[noble]</span> discussion of the Dharma. Monks, would you like to hear the Tathāgata describe the formation and destruction of heaven and earth and the cities and countries where sentient beings live?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān, now would be a good time! We’d be glad to hear it. Once the Bhagavān has explained this, we’ll remember it!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Buddha said, “Monks, listen closely! Listen closely and consider it well! I will explain it for you.”</p>
<h3>The Buddha Realm</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Just as one sun and moon orbit the four continents and shine their light on them, there are a thousand such worlds. In a thousand worlds, there are a thousand suns and moons, a thousand Sumeru mountain kings, four thousand continents, four thousand great continents, four thousand oceans, four thousand great oceans, four thousand nāgas, four thousand great nāgas, four thousand garuḍas, four thousand great garuḍas, four thousand unpleasant destinies, four thousand great unpleasant destinies, four thousand kings, four thousand great kings, seven thousand great trees, eight thousand great hells, ten thousand great mountains, a thousand King Yamas, a thousand four god kings, a thousand Trāyastriṃśa Heavens, a thousand Yama Heavens, a thousand Tuṣita Heavens, a thousand Nirmāṇarati Heavens, a thousand Paranirmitavaśavartin Heavens, and a thousand Brahma Heavens. This is a small thousand worlds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Like one small thousand worlds, a thousand of those small thousand worlds are a medium thousand worlds. Like one medium thousand worlds, a thousand of those medium thousand worlds are a triple-thousand great thousand worlds. Such worlds revolve around as they form and are destroyed. The sentient beings that inhabit them are called a single Buddha realm.”</p>
<h3>The World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Now, this Earth is 168,000 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless <span class='add'>[in the four directions]</span>. Where the earth stops, there’s water. The water is 3,030 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Where the water stops, there’s air. The air is 6,040 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Monks, the ocean’s water is 84,000 yojanas deep, and its bounds are endless. Sumeru the mountain king is 84,000 yojanas in the water, and it rises to a height of 84,000 yojanas above the ocean. Below, it’s roots connect it to the earth with many hard points. That mountain goes straight up without any bends. All sorts of trees grow on it, and the trees produce many fragrances. The fragrances pervade the mountain’s forests. Many noble people, great spirits, and marvelous gods make their homes there. The foundation under that mountain is entirely gold sand. Four crags emerge from that mountain’s four sides that are 700 yojanas high with a mixture of colors throughout and made of the seven treasures. Those four crags are slanted, leaning precariously over the ocean.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Sumeru the mountain king has stairways made of the seven treasures. At the bottom, the stairways are sixty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by a seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Each of the seven walls has four gates. The gates have balustrades, and towers and terraces are above the seven walls. They’re surrounded by scenic parks and lakes where myriad precious flowers and plants grow. The rows of treasure trees are full with flowers and fruit, and they produce fragrances that blow in the four directions to the delight of passersby. Ducks, geese, cakras, and other rare kinds of birds in countless thousands sing peacefully to each other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Furthermore, halfway up Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are forty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the lower stairways.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“At the top of Sumeru the mountain king, the stairways are twenty yojanas wide. On both sides, the path is bordered by seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees … Countless birds of many kinds sing peacefully to each other as they do at the middle stairways.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are yakṣa spirits that live on the lower stairway called Karoṭapāṇi. The yakṣa spirits that live on the middle stairway are called Mālādhāra. The yakṣa spirits that live on the upper stairway are called Sadāmada.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc72'>SC 72</a>“Third, when all the nāga kings throughout Jambudvīpa entertain themselves in their respective palaces, great garuḍa birds take the opportunity to snatch them or their newly born, for they like to eat nāgas.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc142'>SC 142</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The world has noble wheel-turning kings who achieve seven treasures and possess four miraculous virtues.</p>

First is the golden wheel treasure, second is the white elephant treasure, third is the blue horse treasure, fourth is the magic jewel treasure, fifth is the beautiful woman treasure, sixth is the householder treasure, and seventh is the army general treasure.</p>
<h3>The Golden Wheel Treasure</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc144'>SC 144</a>“How does a noble wheel-turning king achieve the golden wheel treasure? If a noble wheel-turning king arises in Jambudvīpa, he’ll be a water-anointed warrior <span class='add'>[king]</span>. During the fifteenth-day full moon, he’ll bathe in a fragrant wash, ascend to his high hall, and entertain himself with a group of maidens. The wheel will spontaneously appear before him. It has a thousand spokes and possesses a glowing light. It’s something made by a heavenly artisan, not something made in this world. It is made of pure gold and about fourteen feet in diameter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc145'>SC 145</a>“After seeing this, the noble wheel-turning king thinks to himself, ‘In the past, I’ve heard senior elders say, “If a water-anointed warrior king bathes in a fragrant wash during the fifteenth-day full moon, ascends to his high hall, and surrounds himself with maidens, the wheel will spontaneously appear before him. It has a thousand spokes and possesses a glowing light. It’s something made by a heavenly artisan, not something made in this world. It’s made of pure gold and fourteen feet in diameter. He’s then known as a noble wheel-turning king.” Now, this wheel has appeared! But is it that one? I had better test this wheel treasure.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc146'>SC 146</a>“The noble wheel-turning king then summons his four armies and faces the golden wheel treasure with his right shoulder bared. He kneels on his right knee, touches the golden wheel with his right hand, and says: ‘Head east. Turn according to the Dharma, and don’t go contrary to the eternal law.’ The wheel then turns east.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc147'>SC 147</a>“The wheel-turning king then follows it, leading his four armies, and four spirits are ahead of the golden wheel, guiding it. The king stops his horses where the wheel stops to dwell. When the lesser kings in the east see the great king arrive, they come to the king with gold bowls holding silver grain and silver bowls holding gold grain. They present them to their chief, saying, ‘Welcome, Great King! The lands in this eastern region are plentiful now <span class='add'>[with many treasures,]</span> and the people are prosperous. Their culture is gentle, loving, and loyal. Please, Noble King, rule them properly! We’ll serve you, right and left, and accept what’s appropriate.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc148'>SC 148</a>“The wheel-turning king tells the lesser kings, ‘Stop, gentlemen! Stop! You’ve given offerings to me, but I will simply rule with the correct Dharma. Don’t go out of your way to serve me, and let no one in the country act contrary to the Dharma. Don’t kill beings yourselves and instruct other people not to kill beings … don’t steal … don’t commit sexual misconduct … don’t speak duplicitously … harshly … falsely … frivolously … don’t be greedy … jealous … don’t hold wrong views … This is what I call my way of ruling.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc149'>SC 149</a>“When the lesser kings hear this instruction, they follow the great king as he tours their countries. He’ll go east until the ocean is in sight, and next travel south, west, and north, going wherever the wheel goes. The kings in those regions each presents their countries in the same way as the lesser countries in the east do.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc150'>SC 150</a>“Here in Jambudvīpa, there’s a land called Fertile Bounty, which has many treasures. It’s forests and rivers are pure, and its terrain is flat and wide. The wheel will travel around it, passing through all its towns, going twelve yojanas east to west and ten yojanas south to north. In the middle of the night, heavenly spirits will build a metropolis surrounded by seven fortress walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, and seven rows of trees decorated with the seven treasures … and countless birds will sing to each other peacefully.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc151'>SC 151</a>“After it’s built, the golden wheel treasure will also enter the city and travel through its streets, going four yojanas east to west and two yojanas south to north. In the middle of the night, heavenly spirits will build a palace hall that’s seven stories tall and made of the seven treasures … and countless birds will sing to each other peacefully in same way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc152'>SC 152</a>“After it’s built, the golden wheel treasure will go up into the sky and hover above the palace hall, complete and unmoving. The noble wheel-turning king will celebrate, ‘This golden wheel treasure is a true sign to me that I really am a noble wheel-turning king now!’ This is his accomplishment of the golden wheel treasure.</p>
<h3>The White Elephant Treasure</h3>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc154'>SC 154</a>“When he sees this, the king will think, ‘This elephant treasure is excellent. If it’s well trained, I could ride it!’ He tests its training, and it’s be capable of doing everything it should. The wheel-turning king then wants to further test the elephant, so he mounts it and rides it out of the city in the morning. He travels around the four oceans and returns when it’s time to eat.</p>

The noble wheel-turning king will be sitting up in his correct <span class='add'>[Dharma]</span> hall in the morning, and the magic jewel treasure will suddenly appear before him. It’s substance and color are transparent and lacks any flaws or defilement.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc160'>SC 160</a>“When he sees this, the king will think, ‘This jewel is marvelous! When it glows, it could light the interior of the palace!’ The wheel-turning king then tests this jewel by summoning his four armies and placing the jewel treasure atop a tall banner. He carries this banner out of the city during a dark night, and the jewel’s light illuminates an area that’s a yojana in radius. Inside the city, people can go about their business as they do during the day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc161'>SC 161</a>“The noble wheel-turning king will celebrate, ‘This magic jewel is a true sign to me that I really am a noble wheel-turning king now!’ This is his accomplishment of the magic jewel treasure.</p>
<h3>The Beautiful Woman Treasure</h3>

Her countenance is agreeable, and her appearance is handsome. She isn’t too tall or short, too crude or fine, too white or black, or too sharp or gentle. In winter, her body is warm, and she’s cool during summer. The hair pores of her whole body exude the scent of sandalwood, and her breath has the fragrance of an utpala flower. Her words are gentle, stimulating, and calm. She’s the first to rise and the last to sit. She doesn’t do anything inappropriate. The noble wheel-turning king isn’t attached to seeing her, so he doesn’t think about her for a moment, much less being intimate with her.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc163'>SC 163</a>“After seeing her, the noble wheel-turning king will celebrate, ‘This beautiful woman treasure is a true sign to me that I really am a noble wheel-turning king now!’ This is his accomplishment of the beautiful woman treasure.</p>
<h3>The Householder Treasure</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc164'>SC 164</a>“How does he accomplish the householder treasure? A householder man will suddenly appear with a natural storehouse of treasures and measureless wealth. The householder will have an eye from past merit that clearly sees hidden treasures in the earth and whether they have owners or not. He sees and knows all this. When the treasure has an owner, he will protect it for them. When a treasure doesn’t have an owner, he will collect it and provide it for the king’s use. The householder treasure goes to the King and says, ‘Great King, you don’t need to worry about paying me a salary. I can take care of myself.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc165'>SC 165</a>“The noble wheel-turning king wants to test the householder treasure. He orders them a boat prepared to go sailing on a river, then he tells the householder, ‘I need a treasure of gold. Quick, give it to me.’</p>

<p>“The householder treasure accepts the king’s command and kneels down on the boat. He puts his right hand into the water, and a precious jar comes out of the water after his hand. Like a caterpillar climbing a tree, that householder treasure is likewise. Putting his hand in the water, a treasure will climb his hand as he lifts it out of the water. He fills the boat up <span class='add'>[with treasures]</span> and then asks the king, ‘How much treasure does the king need?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc167'>SC 167</a>“The noble wheel-turning king says to the householder, ‘Stop, stop! I didn’t need any treasure; it was just a way to test you. You’ve already given offerings to me.’</p>

When he reaches the end of his life, he’ll be like a happy person who ate a little too much and feels a bit unwell. When his life ends, he’ll be born up in the Brahma Heaven.

<h3>The Great Vajra Mountains Protect the World</h3>

They might well soar fifty kilometers into the sky, and they would all be reduced to dust. Like a handful of fine chaff thrown into the air by a strong man, that great wind would likewise blow the Earth away. Those two great diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.</p>

If that wind were to reach the four continents, the sentient beings, mountains, streams, rivers, seas, plants, trees, and forests there would be scorched and wither. As when moisture leaves the plants during the height of summer and they quickly turn brown and wither, that wind would be the same. If it reached this world, the hot air would bake it in the same way. Those two diamond mountain chains block this wind, preventing it from coming. Monks, you should know that those diamond mountains benefit many people. They came about as a result of the conduct of sentient beings.</p>

Twenty lifetimes in the *Ahaha Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Why Hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Why Hell is equal to one lifetime in the Sheep Bleating Hell.

No part of him isn’t burned to a crisp. After this punishment is done, he rejoins his maidens, and they entertain each other. His great ministers likewise receive the same fortunes.”</p>

<h3>Wrong Views about Rebirth in Heaven</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc364'>SC 364</a>The Buddha told the monks, “If sentient beings uphold the nāga precepts, their minds turn to nāgas and perfect the way of nāgas, and then they are born among nāgas. If sentient beings uphold the garuḍa precepts, their minds turn to garuḍas and perfect the way of garuḍas, and then they are born among garuḍas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc365'>SC 365</a>“Sometimes, sentient beings uphold the precepts of rabbits and owls, and their minds turn to perfect the ways of rabbits and owls. They then fall <span class='add'>[to rebirth]</span> among rabbits and owls. Suppose sentient beings uphold the precepts of dogs, the precepts of cattle, the precepts of deer, the precepts of mutes, the precepts of Māṇibhadra, the precepts of fire, the precepts of the moon, precepts of the sun, precepts of water, precepts of giving offerings to fire, or the law of asceticism and defilement and that they think, ‘I’m upholding this … way of mutes … way of Māṇibhadra … way of fire … way of the sun and moon … way of water … way of giving offerings to fire … way of asceticism and defilement … I uphold these virtues in order to be born in heaven.’ These are wrong views.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc366'>SC 366</a>The Buddha said, “I say people with these wrong views are surely headed for two places. Either they’ll be born in hell or they’ll fall to an animal birth.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc390'>SC 390</a>“King Ādarśamukha then had the elephant taken away. He asked the blind men, ‘What was the elephant like?’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc394'>SC 394</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Those of other religions and different trainings are like this.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc396'>SC 396</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Suppose a person doesn’t know suffering,<br>
Doesn’t know how suffering arises,<br>
Again, they don’t know place whence<br>
Suffering can be brought to an end.<br>
Nor can they understand<br>
The path that ceases suffering’s formation.<br>
They miss out on liberation of their mind,<br>
And liberation of wisdom is lost, too.<br>
They can’t reach the root of suffering,<br>
That source of birth, old age, illness, and death.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If someone can truly know suffering,<br>
They’ll know what causes suffering to arise.<br>
They can also know that place whence<br>

They can also well discern<br>
The noble path that ceases suffering’s formation.<br>
They then obtain liberation of their mind<br>
And the liberation of wisdom, too.<br>
Such a person can reach the end<br>
Of the root of this mass of suffering.<br>
They’ll end birth, old age, illness, and death,<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc512'>SC 512</a>“Sometimes, a sentient being commits good physical deeds, speaks good words, and thinks good thoughts. When their body breaks up and their life ends, they are born among the four god kings. Their final consciousness ceases here, and an initial consciousness arises among the four god kings. Because of that consciousness, they have name and form. Because of that name and form, they have the six senses.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc513'>SC 513</a>“When those gods are first born, they’re like one- or two-year-old human children. They spontaneous appear sitting on a god’s knee. That god then says, ‘This is my child!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc514'>SC 514</a>“As a reward for their conduct, knowledge spontaneously arises in them. They think to themselves, ‘What was the conduct that caused me to be born here now?’ Then they also think, ‘I was once among humans and did good physical deeds, spoke good words, and had good thoughts. It was because of this conduct that I’ve been born as a god now. If my life were to end and I were born again among humans, I would be physically, verbally, and mentally pure. I’d redouble my efforts and cultivate these good conducts.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc515'>SC 515</a>“Not long after the child’s birth, they realize that they’re hungry. A treasure bowl then spontaneously appears in front of the child, which is full of spontaneously pure food with a hundred heavenly flavors. If the child has much merit, the food’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the food’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the food’s color is red. The child then takes the food and puts it in their mouth, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc516'>SC 516</a>“When the child is finished eating, they realize that they’re thirsty. A treasure bowl spontaneously appears that’s filled with ambrosia. If the child has much merit, the ambrosia’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the ambrosia’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the ambrosia’s color is red. The child picks up the ambrosia and drinks it, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc517'>SC 517</a>“After the child finishes eating and drinking, their body grows larger until it’s equal to that of other gods. That god then goes into a pool to bathe, washing and enjoying themselves. After enjoying themselves there, the god emerges from the pool and stands under a perfume tree. The perfume tree bends down, and they take many fragrances to rub on their body.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc523'>SC 523</a>“Again, the god goes to a musical instrument tree. The tree bends down, and they take heavenly instruments. With wondrous voices in harmony with the music, they go to forest parks. Seeing countless goddesses singing and playing drums, they smile and chat with them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc524'>SC 524</a>“When those gods go sightseeing, they become defiled and attached. They look east and forget what’s west, or they look west and forget what’s east.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc535'>SC 535</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are three fasts during a half month. What are the three? The eighth day is a fasting day, the fourteenth day is a fasting day, and the fifteenth day is a fasting day. These are the three fasts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc536'>SC 536</a>“Why is there a fast on the eighth day of the month? Every eighth day of the month, the four god kings tell their servants, ‘Go check on the conduct of the world. Examine the multitude of people. Are they dutiful to their parents? Do they respect the ascetics and priests? Do they honor and serve their elders? Do they observe the fasting rules, give offerings, and aid the poor?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc537'>SC 537</a>“After hearing the kings’ instruction, their servants go check on the conduct of the world to know if they are dutiful to their parents, respect the ascetics and priests, honor and serve their elders, and observe the fasting rules, give offerings, and aid the poor. After they’ve examined them, they see that the world’s people aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect the ascetics and priests, don’t honor or serve their elders, and don’t observe the fasting rules, give offerings, or aid the poor. They return to the kings and say, ‘Heavenly Kings, those in the world who are dutiful to their parents, honor their elders, cultivate the fasting rules purely, give offerings, and aid the poor are very few. Very few, indeed!’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc546'>SC 546</a>“Why is there a fast on the fifteenth day? On the fifteenth day fast, the four god kings personally go down to check on the conduct of the world.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc547'>SC 547</a>“The four god king then go to the Sudharma Hall and tell Lord Śakra, ‘Great King, you should know that many sentient beings in the world aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect their elders, don’t cultivate the fasting rules, nor aid the poor.’</p>

<h3>Śakra’s Verse Praising the Fasts</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc552'>SC 552</a>“Lord Śakra then wants the gods rejoice twice as much, so he speaks this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “‘Every month on the eighth day<br>

Those who accept and cultivate the fasting rules<br>
Will become my equals!’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc553'>SC 553</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Lord Śakra speaks this verse, but it’s neither well put nor well spoken. I wouldn’t agree with it. Why is that? That Lord of Gods Śakra hasn’t ended lust, anger, and delusion, and he isn’t free from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble.

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “‘Every month on the eighth day<br>

Will become my equals!’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc555'>SC 555</a>The Buddha told the monks, “When that monk speaks this verse, I call it well put and well spoken. I would agree with it. Why is that? That monk has ended lust, anger, and delusion, and he’s freed from birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble. I say that person is free of the basis for suffering.”</p>
<h3>Yakṣa Spirits that Inhabit the Earth</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc556'>SC 556</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The homes, dwellings, and buildings of all people have yakṣa spirits. None are empty of them. Yakṣa spirits are in all avenues, streets, intersections, butcher shops, markets, and graveyards. None are empty of them. All those yakṣa spirits are named for their places of refuge. They’re named for the people, towns, cities, countries, lands, mountains, and rivers in which they take refuge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc557'>SC 557</a>The Buddha told the monks, “All trees, even the smallest of them that are the size of wheel hubs, have yakṣa spirits who take refuge in them. None of them are empty. All men and women when they are first born have yakṣa spirits who protect them. At the time of their death, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc558'>SC 558</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Suppose there are practitioners from other religions who ask, ‘Gentlemen, suppose that all men and women have yakṣa spirits who follow them as protectors from when they are first born. When they’re about to die, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die. Why are there yakṣa spirits who harass people, or are there no yakṣa spirits who harass people?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc559'>SC 559</a>“Supposing someone asks this question, you should answer in this way, ‘Worldly people do things contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There may be only one yakṣa spirit for every hundred or thousand of these people, just as a herd of a hundred or a thousand cattle or sheep has only one a person tending it. Those yakṣa spirits are likewise for people who act contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There’s only one spirit guarding a hundred or a thousand of those people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc560'>SC 560</a>“Suppose there are people who practice the good Dharma, who’s views are correct and act according to their belief, and who perfect the ten good deeds. One such person has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them, just as the king or a king’s minister has a hundred or a thousand people guarding them. They are likewise. A single person who practices the good Dharma and perfects the ten good deeds has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them. As a result of this, some worldly people are harassed by yakṣa spirits, and some are not harassed by them.”</p>

<h3>On Clouds, Lightning, and Rain</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc601'>SC 601</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are four kinds of clouds. What are the four? The first is white-colored, the second is black-colored, the third is red-colored, and the fourth is crimson-colored. The white clouds have a large amount of earth element in them. The black clouds have a large amount of water element in them. The red clouds have a large among of fire element in them. The crimson clouds have a large among of wind element in them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc602'>SC 602</a>“Those clouds are sometimes five kilometers, ten kilometers, fifteen kilometers, twenty kilometers … 2,000 kilometers away from the Earth. The exception is right after the eon begins when the clouds go up to the Ābhāsvara Heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc603'>SC 603</a>“Lightning has four kinds. What are the four? Eastern lightning, which is called Body Light. Southern lightning, which is called Hard to Destroy. Western lightning, which is called Streaming Fire. Northern lightning, which is called Fixed Illumination.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc604'>SC 604</a>“Why are there these lightning flashes in the clouds and sky? Sometimes, Body Light and Hard to Destroy touch each other. Sometimes Body Light and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes the Body Light and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Stream of Fire and Fixed Illumination touch each other. These are the reasons that there are lightning flashes in the sky and clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc605'>SC 605</a>“Again, why does the sound of thunder happen in the sky and clouds? Sometimes, the earth and water elements come into contact in the sky. Sometimes, the earth and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the earth and wind elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and wind elements come into contact. These are the reasons the sound of thunder happens in the sky and clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc606'>SC 606</a>“There are five causes and conditions that make predicting rain uncertain and confuse forecasters. What are the five? First, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the clouds are baked by too much fire element and don’t release rain. This is the first reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc607'>SC 607</a>“Second, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc608'>SC 608</a>“Third, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, a great asura approaches, disperses the clouds, and sends them over the ocean. This is the <span class='add'>[third]</span> reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc609'>SC 609</a>“Fourth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the master of clouds and master of rain are careless and lustful, so they never release the rain. This is the <span class='add'>[fourth]</span> reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc610'>SC 610</a>“Fifth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the world’s population behaves contrary to the Dharma. They carelessly do impure deeds, and they are stingy, jealous, and hold deluded views. This causes the heavens not to release its rain. This is the <span class='add'>[fifth]</span> reason forecasters are mistaken. These are the five causes and conditions for forecasters to be uncertain about rain.</p>

<h3>The Four Measureless Eons</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc611'>SC 611</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are four periods that last a long time, that are measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc612'>SC 612</a>“What are the four? First is the gradual conflagration of the world. When it destroys the world, it’s a very long period that’s measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Second is the period of void after the world’s destruction. There’s no world for a very long time, and it extends for a great distance. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Third is the initial arising of heaven and earth. When the world is forming, it’s a very long period. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated. Fourth, the period after heaven and earth lasts after it forms is a very long time that’s measureless and limitless. The number of years, months, and days can’t be calculated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc613'>SC 613</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The world has three catastrophes. What are the three? First is the catastrophe of fire. Second is the catastrophe of water. Third is the catastrophe of wind. There are three upper limits to these catastrophes. What are the three? First is the Ābhāsvara Heaven. Second is the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven. Third is the Bṛhatphala Heaven. The catastrophe of fire reaches the Ābhāsvara Heaven and stops there. The catastrophe of water reaches the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven, and stops there. The catastrophe of wind reaches the Bṛhatphala Heaven and stops there.</p>
<h3>The Catastrophe of Fire</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc614'>SC 614</a>“What is the catastrophe of fire? When the catastrophe of fire is about to happen, the world’s people all practice the correct Dharma. They have right view, aren’t deluded, and cultivate the ten good deeds. When they practice these things, the people attain the second dhyāna, and they leap up into the sky. Those people on the noble path, the heavenly path, and the Brahma path call out from above: ‘Good people, you should know the happiness of the second dhyāna without perception or examination! The second dhyāna is happiness!’</p>
<p>“When the world’s people hear this call, they look up and say to them, ‘Excellent, excellent! Please explain for us the path of the second dhyāna that has no perception or examination!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc615'>SC 615</a>“When the people in the sky hear that, they explain to them the way of the second dhyāna without perception or examination. When the world’s people hear that explanation, they cultivate the path of the second dhyāna without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc616'>SC 616</a>“When sentient beings’ punishment in hell is finished and their lives there end, they’re reborn among humans. They too cultivate the second dhyāna that’s without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end. Sentient beings born as animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … four god kings … Trāyastriṃśa gods … Yama gods … Tuṣita gods … Nirmāṇarati gods … Paranirmitavaśavartin gods … Brahma gods are reborn among humans when their lives end. They too cultivate the second dhyāna that’s without perception or examination, and they’re born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc617'>SC 617</a>“As a result of these causes, the destiny of hell is ended … animals … hungry ghosts … asuras … Brahma heavens is ended.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc618'>SC 618</a>“As this happens, hell disappears first, and then animal births disappear after it. After animal births are gone, the hungry ghosts disappear. After the hungry ghosts are gone, the asuras disappear. After the asuras are gone, the four god kings disappear. After the four god kings are gone, the Trāyastriṃśa gods disappear. After the Trāyastriṃśa gods are gone, the Yama gods disappear. After the Yama gods are gone, the Tuṣita gods disappear. After the Tuṣita gods are gone, the Nirmāṇarati gods disappear. After the Nirmāṇarati gods are gone, the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods disappear. After the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods are gone, the Brahma gods disappear. After the Brahma gods are gone, then humans disappear with none remaining. After humans are gone with none remaining, the world is destroyed when the catastrophe takes place. Afterward, no rain falls from the heavens, and the hundred grains, grasses, and trees naturally wither and die.”</p>

It blows on the water and agitates it. The crashing of the waves is immense, and a mass of foam accumulates. The wind blows it off of the water and into the sky. It spontaneously hardens there, forming the Śubhakṛtsna Heaven’s palace. It has a mix of assorted colors made of the seven treasures.

<h2>Chapter 11: Three Interim Eons</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc786'>SC 786</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are three interim eons. What are the three? The first is called the eon of warfare, the second is called the eon of famine, and the third is called the eon of plague.</p>
<h3>The Eon of Warfare</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc787'>SC 787</a>“What is the eon of warfare? The people of this world originally lived for 40,000 years. After that, their life spans were reduced to 20,000 years. After that, their life spans were reduced further to 10,000 years. Their life spans became 1,000 years … 500 years … 300 years … 200 years until today when few people live for more than 100 years, and many live for less. After that, people’s life spans are reduced to ten years. At that point, woman are married at five months old.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc788'>SC 788</a>“In that time, there are delicious flavors in the world such as those of ghee, honey, rock honey, and black rock honey. These delicious flavors naturally disappear, the five grains stop growing, and only weeds and grass remain. In that time, superior clothing made of twilled silk, plain silk, cotton, and linen is no more. There’s only crudely woven grass clothing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc789'>SC 789</a>“In that time, brambles, biting insects, scorpions, vipers, and venomous creatures appear all over the land. Gold, silver, beryl, and the rest of the seven treasures naturally disappear from the land. It’s filled with just rocks, sand, and rubbish.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc790'>SC 790</a>“In that time, sentient beings just increasingly do the ten bad deeds, and the names of the ten good deeds aren’t heard anymore. Without names for good deeds, how could anyone practice them?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc791'>SC 791</a>“People then who aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect their elders, and do evil are given offerings, and people respect and serve them. It’s just as today when people who are dutiful to their parents, respectful to their elders, and do good are given offerings, and people respect and serve them. Those people do evil and get offerings in the same way. When their lives end, they fall to animal births, just as people today <span class='add'>[who are respected]</span> are born up in heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc792'>SC 792</a>“In that time, people look at each other harboring malice, wishing only to kill each other. They’re like hunters who see a herd of deer and want only to kill them. They don’t have a single good thought. Those people are like that. They want only to kill each other and don’t have a single good thought.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc793'>SC 793</a>“In that time, the land consists of gully streams, river valleys, mountain precipices, and hills. There’s not a single level plain. People travel in fear, worrying with their hair standing on end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc794'>SC 794</a>“The eon of warfare takes place in seven days. People pick up grass, wood, bricks, and stones, and they turn into swords in their hands. The swords have sharp edges, being suitable for cutting anything. They then take turns hurting each other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc795'>SC 795</a>“When intelligent people see people hurting each other with swords, they flee in terror. They go into mountain forests and caves where no one else lives and hide there for seven days. They think and say to each other, ‘I won’t hurt anyone! Let no one hurt me!’ Those people stay alive during those seven days by eating grass, wood, and roots. After seven days have passed, they come back out of the mountain forests.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc796'>SC 796</a>“At that point, someone else spots them and rejoices. They say, ‘I see someone now who’s alive! I see someone now who’s alive!’ Like a parent recognizing a child whom they haven’t seen for a long time, they rejoice and celebrate, unable to control themselves. That person is likewise. They rejoice and celebrate, being unable to control themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc797'>SC 797</a>“Those people cry and lament to each other for seven days. Then, they cheer each other up for seven days, rejoicing and congratulating each other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc798'>SC 798</a>“After their bodies break up and their lives end, those people fall to hell. Why is that? They had always harbored anger and malice toward each other, so it was because of their lack of humanity. This is eon of warfare.”</p>
<h3>The Eon of Famine</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc799'>SC 799</a>The Buddha told the monks, “What is the eon of famine? In that time, people often behave contrary to the Dharma. Deluded by wrong views, they commit the ten bad deeds. Because they do evil, no rain falls from the heavens. The hundred grasses wither and die, and the five grains aren’t harvested, only stalks and straw.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc800'>SC 800</a>“What is the famine? In that time, the people sweep up grain from fields, markets, roads, and garbage dumps to keep themselves alive. This is the famine.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc801'>SC 801</a>“Again, during the famine, people go to shops, butchers, and cemetery grounds. They dig up bones and make broth from them that they drink to survive. This is the white bone famine.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc802'>SC 802</a>“Again, during the eon of famine, the five grains become grass and trees when people plant them. The people then pick flowers and make broth from them to drink.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc803'>SC 803</a>“Again, during the famine, plant and tree flowers fall and cover the land. People sweep the flowers up and cook them to survive. This is the grass and tree famine.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc804'>SC 804</a>“In that time, sentient beings fall to the hungry ghosts when their bodies break up and their lives end. Why is that? It’s because those people always harbored greediness during the eon of famine. Having no focus on generosity, they are unwilling to share <span class='add'>[their food]</span> and aren’t mindful of other people’s hardships. This is the eon of famine.”</p>
<h3>The Eon of Plague</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc805'>SC 805</a>The Buddha told the monks, “What is the eon of plague? In that time, the world’s people cultivate the correct Dharma, have right view, don’t have deluded views, and perfect the ten good deeds. A yakṣa spirit comes from another world, and the yakṣa spirits in this world are reckless and lustful, so they can’t protect the people here. The yakṣa spirit from another world then attacks and disturbs this world’s people. It hits, whips, and steals their vitality. Disturbing people’s minds, it drives and threatens them as it leads them away.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc806'>SC 806</a>“It’s like when a king orders his generals to defend the country, and bandits come from another direction to attack. Those reckless people attack country’s villages. This is likewise. A yakṣa spirit from another world captures the people here by hitting and whipping them. It steals their vitality, driving and threatening them as it leads them away.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc807'>SC 807</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Even if the yakṣa spirits of this world aren’t reckless and lustful, the yakṣa that comes from another world is powerful. The yakṣas of this world are afraid of it and run away. That great yakṣa spirit then attacks and disturbs people. It hits and whips them, stealing their vitality. It then kills them and leaves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc808'>SC 808</a>“It’s like when a king or a king’s great minister sends his generals to protect the people, and the generals are careful and not reckless at all. Barbarian generals come from another direction with large armies to destroy their cities and towns, looting the people’s possessions. This is likewise. Even when the yakṣa spirits in this world aren’t reckless and lustful, the yakṣa from another world has great power. The yakṣa spirits here are afraid of it and run away. That great yakṣa spirit then attacks and disturbs people. It hits and whips them, stealing their vitality. It then kills them and leaves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc809'>SC 809</a>“During the eon of plague, people are born up in heaven when their bodies break up and their lives end. Why is that? It’s because people in that time are kind to each other. They take turns asking, ‘Are you sick? Are you in good health?’ For this reason, they are born up in heaven. Therefore, this is called the eon of plague.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc810'>SC 810</a>“These are the three medium eons.”</p>
<h2>Chapter 12: The Origins of the World</h2>
<h3>The Repopulation of the World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc811'>SC 811</a>The Buddha told the monks, “After the catastrophe of fire has passed and the earth and heavens of this world are about to reform, the remaining sentient beings’ merits, actions, and lives come to an end. At the end of their lives in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they are born into an empty Brahma abode. Their minds are stained by attachment to the place. Delighted by that abode, they wish other sentient beings would be born there with them. After they make that wish, the merits, actions, and lives of other sentient beings come to an end. When their bodies break up and their lives end in the Ābhāsvara Heaven, they’re born in that empty Brahma abode.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc812'>SC 812</a>“The first being born in the Brahma Heaven thinks to himself, ‘I am the Brahma King, the Great Brahma Heaven King! I have no creator, I’ve spontaneously come to be, and I’m subject to no one. I’m the highest sovereign of a thousand worlds, skilled in various meanings, my wealth is bountiful, and I’m the creator of all things. I’m both father and mother to all sentient beings.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc813'>SC 813</a>“After that, the Brahma gods who arrive after him also think, ‘He’s the first Brahma god, the Brahma King, the Great Brahma Heaven King. He spontaneously came to be, and he’s subject to no one. He’s the highest sovereign of a thousand worlds, skilled in various meanings, his wealth is bountiful, and he’s the creator of all things. He’s both father and mother to all sentient beings. We’ve come to exist from him.’ That Brahma Heaven King looked handsome and young, always like a youth. Therefore, that Brahma god was named Kumāra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc814'>SC 814</a>“At a certain point, this world is restored again. The sentient beings that were born in the Ābhāsvara Heaven are numerous. Born here spontaneously, they’re nourished by joy. Their bodies glow with their own light, and they have the miraculous ability to fly. Their happiness has no obstacle, and their life spans are very long.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc815'>SC 815</a>“After that, the world forms a great body of water that fills up every place. The world then is under a great darkness. There’s no sun, moon, stars, nor day and night. There’s no way to count the years, months, or the four seasons.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc816'>SC 816</a>“Some time after that, the world again changes. The merits, actions, and lives of more sentient beings in the Ābhāsvara Heaven come to an end, and they are born here when their lives end. All are born here spontaneously, and they are nourished by joy. Their bodies glow with their own light, and they have the miraculous ability to fly. Their happiness has no obstacles, and their life spans are very long.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc817'>SC 817</a>“In that time, there’s no male or female, noble or ignoble, high or low, or beings with different names. That host is born together in the world, so they are called ‘host born.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc818'>SC 818</a>“At that point, the Earth has a spontaneously produced flavor of earth, which solidifies into earth that’s like ghee. When that flavor of earth is produced, it’s likewise. It’s like butter that tastes as sweet as honey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc819'>SC 819</a>“After that, the sentient beings use their hands to taste what flavor it has. With the first taste, they realize they like it, and then they become attached to tasting it. Thus, they each take turns tasting it without stopping, and then they go after it greedily. They scoop it up with their hands and form it into lumps to eat, and they don’t stop eating it. Other sentient beings see this and emulate them, eating it and not stopping.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc820'>SC 820</a>“The bodies of these sentient beings become rough, and their glow gradually disappears. They no longer have the miraculous ability to fly, either. At that point, there has yet to be a sun or moon, so when the glow of the sentient beings goes out, the world is plunged into a darkness that’s no different than before.</p>
<h3>The Sun</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc821'>SC 821</a>“A long, long time after that, a windstorm blows on the ocean’s water, which is 84,000 yojanas deep. It divides into two whirlwinds that grab the palace hall of the sun and place it half as high as Mount Sumeru, where it takes up the sun’s orbit. It rises in the east and sets in the west, revolving around the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc822'>SC 822</a>“When a second sun palace rises in the east and sets in the west, the sentient beings there say, ‘This must be the sun from yesterday.’</p>
<p>“Others say, ‘It’s not the one from yesterday.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc823'>SC 823</a>“A third sun palace circles Mount Sumeru, rising in the east and setting in the west. Then, the sentient beings say, ‘That’s definitely the same sun.’ The word ‘sun’ means the first cause of illumination; therefore, it’s called the sun. ‘Sun’ also has two meanings. The first is to abide at a constant frequency, and the second is a palace hall.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc824'>SC 824</a>“The palace hall’s four sides are round because they’re seen from far away. It’s made of heavenly gold mixed with crystal that’s neither cold nor hot. Two-thirds of it is pure and unadulterated heavenly gold, inside and out, and its light shines far away. A third of it is pure and unadulterated crystal, inside and out, and its light shines far away. The sun palace is fifty-one yojanas across, and the palace walls are made of a mineral that’s as light as oak or pine wood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc825'>SC 825</a>“That palace has seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, seven treasure bells, and seven rows of trees encircling it with decorations made of the seven treasures.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc827'>SC 827</a>“Those balustrades have gold balusters and silver rails, silver balusters and gold rails, crystal balusters and beryl rails, beryl balusters and crystal rails, ruby balusters and emerald rails, emerald balusters and ruby rails, and coral balusters with rails made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc828'>SC 828</a>“The gold nettings have silver bells, and the silver nettings have gold bells. The beryl nettings have crystal bells, and the crystal nettings have beryl bells. The ruby nettings have emerald bells, and the emerald nettings have ruby bells. The coral nettings have bells made of many treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc829'>SC 829</a>“The gold trees have silver leaves, flowers, and fruit. The silver trees have gold leaves, flowers, and fruit.

The ruby trees have emerald <span class='add'>[leaves]</span>, flowers, and fruit. The emerald trees have ruby <span class='add'>[leaves]</span>, flowers, and fruit.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc830'>SC 830</a>“The palace walls have four gates. The gates have seven stair steps, and they’re encircled by balustrades, towers, terraces, forest parks, and lakes alongside each other in that order. Myriad treasure flowers grow in rows along with a variety of fruit trees with flowers and leaves of assorted colors. The fragrance of the trees is sweet-smelling and spreads far away in all directions. Flocks of various birds sing to each other peacefully.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc831'>SC 831</a>“There are five winds that hold the sun palace up. First is the holding wind, second is the sustaining wind, third is the receiving wind, fourth is the turning wind, and fifth is the controlling wind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc832'>SC 832</a>“The sun god stands in his correct hall, which is made of pure gold and sixteen yojanas tall. The hall has four doors with balustrades encircling it. The sun god’s throne is a half yojana across, made of the seven treasures, and pure and soft as heavenly cloth. The sun god’s own body emits light that shines on his golden hall. The golden hall’s light then shines on the sun palace, and the sun palace’s light shines on the four continents.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc833'>SC 833</a>“The sun god lives for 500 heavenly years, and his descendants who succeed him are no different. His palace is indestructible until it ends after one eon.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc834'>SC 834</a>“As the sun palace moves, the sun god has no notion of that motion. He says, ‘Walking or standing still, I’m always enjoying myself with the five desires.’ As the sun palace moves, countless hundreds of thousands of great gods and spirits are ahead of it leading the way. They do so gladly without tiring of it, being delighted by its speed. This is the reason the sun god is named ‘Quickness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc835'>SC 835</a>“The sun god’s body emits 1,000 rays of light. 500 rays shine downwards and 500 rays shine horizontally. As a result of the virtue of his past deeds, he has 1,000 rays of light. Therefore, the sun god is called ‘1,000 Rays of Light.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc836'>SC 836</a>“What are the virtues of his past deeds? Sometimes, a person gives offerings to ascetics and priests and gives aid to the poor. He gives gifts of meals, clothing, medicine, horses and elephants, vehicles, housing, lamps, and candles. When he distributes such things, he does so according to what’s needed and doesn’t go contrary to people’s wishes. He supports noble people who observe the precepts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc837'>SC 837</a>“As a result these diverse and countless causes of Dharma joy and light, his heart is good, and he’s joyful. He’s like a water-anointed king who has just ascended to the throne. His heart is good, and he’s joyful in the same way. When his body breaks up and his life ends, he becomes the sun god and attains the sun palace hall because of these circumstances. Because he possesses 1,000 rays of light, these are said to be the good deeds that obtain 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc838'>SC 838</a>“Again, what’s called the past deeds of light? Some people don’t kill beings, don’t steal, don’t engage in sexual misconduct, don’t speak duplicitously, harshly, falsely, or frivolously, aren’t greedy or hateful, and don’t have wrong views. Because of these circumstances, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. It’s like a major crossroads with a large bathing pool that’s clear and unpolluted. People traveling from far away are exhausted, hot, and thirsty when they arrive at the pool. They go in to bathe and refresh themselves, rejoicing and delighting in it. Those ten good deeds make their hearts good, and they’re joyful in the same way. When such people’s bodies break up and their lives end, they become the sun god. Dwelling in the sun palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light. For these reasons, <span class='add'>[these deeds]</span> are called good deeds of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc839'>SC 839</a>“Again, what is the reason for called them ‘<span class='add'>[good deeds of]</span> 1,000 rays of light’? Some people don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t engage in sex, don’t lie, and don’t drink alcohol. Because of these causes, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. When their bodies break up and their lives end, they become the sun god. Dwelling in the sun palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light.

<h3>Ten Reasons Sunlight Is Hot</h3>

<h3>The Moon</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc866'>SC 866</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are times when the moon palace’s round form waxes and wanes, and its light decreases and disappears. Therefore, the moon palace is named for its reduction. ‘Moon’ has two meanings. The first is to abide in eternal liberation. The second is the palace hall.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc867'>SC 867</a>“It’s round because it’s seen from far away in all four directions. It’s made of heavenly silver and beryl that’s neither cold nor hot. Two-thirds of it is pure and unadulterated heavenly silver, inside and out, and it’s light shines far away. One-third of it is pure and unadulterated beryl, inside and out, and its light shines far away.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc868'>SC 868</a>“The moon palace is forty-nine yojanas across. The palace’s walls are a mineral that’s light as oak or pine wood. The palace has seven walls, seven balustrades, seven nettings, seven treasure bells, and seven rows of trees encircling it with decorations made of seven treasures … and countless birds sing to each other peacefully.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc869'>SC 869</a>“There are five winds that hold the moon palace up. First is the holding wind, second is the sustaining wind, third is the receiving wind, fourth is the turning wind, and fifth is the controlling wind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc870'>SC 870</a>“The moon god stands in his correct hall, which is made of beryl and sixteen yojanas tall. That hall has four doors with balustrades encircling it. The moon god’s throne is a half yojanas across, made of the seven treasures, and pure and as soft as heavenly cloth. The moon god’s own body emits light that shines on his beryl hall. The beryl hall’s light then shines on the moon palace, and the moon palace’s light shines on the four continents.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc871'>SC 871</a>“The moon god lives for 500 heavenly years, and his descendants who succeed him are no different. His palace is indestructible until it ends after one eon.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc872'>SC 872</a>“As the moon palace moves, the moon god has no notion of that motion. He says, ‘Walking or standing still, I’m always enjoying myself with the five desires.’ As the moon palace moves, countless hundreds of thousands of great gods and spirits are ahead of it leading the way. They do so gladly without tiring of it, being delighted by its speed. This is the reason the moon god is called ‘Quickness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc873'>SC 873</a>“The moon god’s body emits 1,000 rays of light. 500 rays shine downwards and 500 rays shine horizontally. As a result of the virtue of his past deeds, he has 1,000 rays of light. Therefore, the moon god is called ‘1,000 Rays of Light.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc874'>SC 874</a>“What are the virtues of his past deeds? Sometimes, a worldly person gives offerings to ascetics and priests and gives aid to the poor. He gives gifts of meals, clothing, medicine, horses and elephants, vehicles, housing, lamps, and candles. When he distributes such things, he does so according to what’s needed and doesn’t go contrary to people’s wishes. He supports noble people who observe the precepts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc875'>SC 875</a>“As a result these diverse and countless causes of Dharma joy and light, his heart is good, and he’s joyful. He’s like a water-anointed king who has just ascended to the throne. His heart is good, and he’s joyful in the same way. When his body breaks up and his life ends, he becomes the moon god and attains the moon palace hall because of these circumstances. Because he possesses 1,000 rays of light, these are said to be the good deeds that obtain 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc876'>SC 876</a>“Again, what are called the deeds of 1,000 rays of light? Some worldly people don’t kill beings, don’t steal, don’t engage in sexual misconduct, don’t speak duplicitously, harshly, falsely, or frivolously, aren’t greedy or hateful, and don’t have wrong views. Because of these circumstances, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. It’s like a major crossroads with a large bathing pool that’s clear and unpolluted. People traveling from far away are exhausted, hot, and thirsty when they arrive at the pool. They go in to bathe and refresh themselves, rejoicing and delighting in it. Those ten good deeds make their hearts good, and they’re joyful in the same way. When such people’s bodies break up and their lives end, they become the moon god. Dwelling in the moon palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light. For these reasons, <span class='add'>[these deeds]</span> are called good deeds of 1,000 rays of light.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc877'>SC 877</a>“Again, what are the causes for obtaining 1,000 rays of light? Some worldly people don’t kill, don’t steal, don’t engage in sex, don’t lie, and don’t drink alcohol. Because of these causes, their hearts are good, and they’re joyful. When their bodies break up and their lives end, they become the moon god. Dwelling in the moon palace, they possess 1,000 rays of light. For these reasons, they are called the good deeds of 1,000 rays of light.</p>

The moon travels north in the same way.</p>
<h3>The Waxing and Waning of the Moon</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc879'>SC 879</a>“What’s the reason the moon palace gradually decreases and disappears? There are three causes for the moon palace to decrease and disappear. First is when the moon rises diagonally. This is the first reason the moon decreases and disappears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc880'>SC 880</a>“Furthermore, the great ministers put on blue robes inside the moon palace. Where they stand becomes blue, so the moon decreases. This is the second reason the moon disappears day by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc881'>SC 881</a>“Furthermore, the sun palace has sixty rays of light that shine on the moon palace. They outshine it, which makes it disappear. As parts of the moon are dimmed, it decreases and disappears. This is the third reason the moon’s light decreases and disappears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc882'>SC 882</a>“Again, what’s the reason the moon’s light gradually becomes full? There are three causes that make the moon’s light gradually become full. What are the three? First, the moon’s facing is a perfect square, so the moon’s light becomes full.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc883'>SC 883</a>“Second, the moon palace’s ministers take off their blue robes. The moon god sits in his place on the fifteenth day to entertain himself. His light then shines everywhere and blocks the light of the heavens, so it’s light is completely full. It’s just as when the flame of a large torch among lit lamps blocks the light of the lamps. That moon god is likewise. On the fifteenth day, the myriad lights of the host of gods are blocked. The moon’s light is the only one that shines in the same way. This is the second reason.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc884'>SC 884</a>“Third, although the sun god has sixty rays of light that shine on the moon palace, the moon god is able to counteract them on the fifteenth day so that the moon’s light isn’t obscured. This is the third cause for the moon palace to become completely full without any decrease.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc885'>SC 885</a>“Again, what’s the reason for a dark shadow to be on the moon? When the moon is in the shadow of the Jambu tree, that causes the moon to have a shadow on it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc886'>SC 886</a>The Buddha told the monks, “One’s mind should be like the moon, clear and unheated. When going to a donor’s home, be mindful and unconfused.</p>
<h3>Other Features of the World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc887'>SC 887</a>“Again, what’s reason for the great rivers to exist? It’s because the sun and moon have heat. That heat causes hot <span class='add'>[weather]</span>. Hot weather causes sweating. The sweat forms large rivers, so the world has great rivers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc888'>SC 888</a>“What’s the reason for the world’s five types of seed? There are great windstorms that don’t destroy the world. They blows seeds into the world, and they grow in the lands here. The first are root seeds, second are stem seeds, third are joint seeds, fourth are the hollow seeds, and fifth are embryonic seeds. These are the five seeds. For this reason, five types of seed arise in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc889'>SC 889</a>“At noon here in Jambudvīpa, the sun is setting in Pūrvavideha, the sun is rising in Godānīya, and it’s midnight in Uttarakuru. At noon in Godānīya, the sun is setting in Jambudvīpa, the sun is rising in Uttarakuru, and it’s midnight in Pūrvavideha. At noon in Uttarakuru, the sun is setting in Godānīya, the sun is rising in Pūrvavideha, and it’s midnight in Jambudvīpa. At noon in Pūrvavideha, the sun is setting in Uttarakuru, the sun is rising in Jambudvīpa, and it’s midnight in Godānīya.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc890'>SC 890</a>“What’s east in Jambudvīpa is west in Pūrvavideha. What’s west in Jambudvīpa is east in Godānīya. What’s west in Godānīya is east in Uttarakuru. What’s west in Uttarakuru is east in Pūrvavideha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc891'>SC 891</a>“Jambudvīpa is named after the Jambu <span class='add'>[tree]</span>. Under it, there’s a mountain of gold that’s 30 yojanas tall and causes the Jambu tree to grow, so it’s called Jambu’s gold. The Jambu tree has fruit that resembles mushrooms and tastes as sweet as honey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc892'>SC 892</a>“That tree has five large corners. On it’s four sides are four corners, and one corner is above it. Gandharvas eat the fruit on the east corner. People from the seven countries eat the fruit on the south corner. The first country is Kuru,  the second is Koravya (?), third is Videha, fourth is Suvideha (?), fifth is Manda (?), sixth is Bārāṇasī, and seventh is Parikhā (?). Sea serpents eat the fruit on the west corner. Animals eat the fruit on the  north corner. Gods of the stellar constellations eat the fruit from the top corner.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc893'>SC 893</a>“North of the seven great countries, there are seven great black mountains. The first is Bare Land, second is White Stork, third is Palace Protector, fourth is Sage Mountain, fifth is High Mountain, sixth is Dhyāna Mountain, and seventh is Land Mountain. On these seven black mountains, there are seven priestly sages. These seven sages who live on them are named Good Lord, Good Light, Palace Protector, Sage, Palace Defender, Gaṇana, and Increase.”</p>
<h3>The Devolution of Sentient Beings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc894'>SC 894</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The first sentient beings of the eon eat the flavor of the earth, and they live in the world for a long time. Those that often eat it become cruder in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I am superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they maintain grudges, the earth flavor dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc895'>SC 895</a>“Next, the earth grows a skin shaped like thin rice cakes, and it’s color, flavor, and aroma is pure. At that point, the sentient beings gather in one place and feel miserable, lament, and beat their breasts. They say, ‘Oh, what a disaster! The flavor of the earth is nowhere to be found now!’ It’s like present-day people who discover a rich and delicious flavor, and they praise it as delicious and good. Later, they miss it and are saddened. Those sentient beings are likewise, feeling miserable and regretful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc896'>SC 896</a>“After they eat the earth skin, they slowly get its flavor. Those that often eat it become cruder in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I’m superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they harbor grudges, the earth skin dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc897'>SC 897</a>“After that, another earth skin is produced that’s even cruder. It has the color of heavenly flowers, it’s as soft as heavenly cloth, and its flavor is like honey. The sentient beings again take and eat it, and they live in the world for a long time. Those that often eat it become degraded in appearance, and those that seldom eat it are shiny in appearance. After a while, they notice that the appearance of the other sentient beings has become superior or inferior, and they argue with each other. ‘I’m superior to you! You are not my equal!’ Self and other enter their minds. Because they harbor grudges, the earth skin dries up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc898'>SC 898</a>“After that, there’s spontaneous rice that lacks any chaff or husks, doesn’t need to be seasoned, and possesses many delicious flavors. At that point, the sentient beings gather and say, ‘Oh, what a disaster! The earth skin is nowhere to be found now!’ They are like present-day people who encounter some unfortunate difficulty and exclaim, ‘What a pain!’ Those sentient beings likewise feel miserable and sigh.</p>
<h3>Families and Homes Arise</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc899'>SC 899</a>“After that, the sentient beings take the rice and eat it, and their bodies become uglier, having male and female forms. They look at each other and chase after notions of desire. They go to private places together and do impure things. Other sentient beings that see them say, ‘Oh, this is wrong! How can those sentient beings go and do such things together?’ They go to the impure males and rebuke them, telling them to repent their mistake. ‘What you did was wrong!’ Then, they throw them to the ground.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc900'>SC 900</a>“When the female sees that male thrown to the ground, their repentance doesn’t happen. Instead, the woman brings him food. Other sentient beings that see this ask the woman, ‘Who are you going to give that food you’re carrying?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc901'>SC 901</a>“The woman answers, ‘That repentant sentient being who fell into unwholesome conduct. I’m bringing this food to him.’ Because she says this, the name ‘unwholesome master’ comes to be in the world. Because she brings this food to that man, the name ‘wife’ comes to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc902'>SC 902</a>“After that, sentient beings pursue their lust indulgently and unskillful qualities increase. In order to conceal themselves, they build houses. As a result of this, the term ‘home’ comes to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc903'>SC 903</a>“After that, sentient beings increasingly indulge in lust, and they seek to become husband and wife. The life span, conduct, and merits of other sentient beings in the Ābhāsvara Heaven come to an end. When their lives end, they’re reborn here in a mother’s womb. As a result, the term ‘womb’ comes to exist in the world.</p>
<h3>Cities Are Built and Property Is Invented</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc904'>SC 904</a>“At that point, the city of Campā is built. Next, the city of Kāśi is built, and then the city of Rājagṛha is built. They begin building them when the sun rises and complete them when the sun rises. As a result, the world has the names of large cities and districts that are governed by kings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc905'>SC 905</a>“Sentient beings begin eating the spontaneous rice. When they gather it in the morning, it’s ripe again by evening. When they gather it in the evening, and it’s ripen again by morning. After they gather it, the rice grows back again without stems or stalks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc906'>SC 906</a>“Some sentient beings then silently think to themselves, ‘I gather this rice every day. It’s tiresome for me to do that. Now, I’ll gather enough to supply myself for several days.’ Then, when they gather the rice, they accumulate enough for several days.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc907'>SC 907</a>“Later, someone else asks that person, ‘Do you want to go gather rice together?’</p>

<p>“They reply, ‘I’ve already gathered three days’ worth of rice. If you want to gather rice, do as you like.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc910'>SC 910</a>“The other person then thinks, ‘That man can gather three days’ worth of rice. Why couldn’t I gather five days’ worth of rice?’ Afterward, they gather five days’ worth of rice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc911'>SC 911</a>“Because of these sentient beings competing to accumulate rice, the rice begins to grow chaff and husks, and it doesn’t grow back after being gathered anymore. Instead, it turns to withered stalks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc912'>SC 912</a>“At that point, the sentient beings gathered in one place and felt miserable, lamenting and beating their breasts. They said, ‘Oh, what a disaster!’ They reproach themselves, saying, ‘Originally, we were born spontaneously and were nourished with thought. Our bodies glowed with their own light, and we had the miraculous ability of flight. Our happiness had no obstacles.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc913'>SC 913</a>“‘After that, the flavor of the earth first arose, which was perfect in color and flavor. We ate this flavor of the earth, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>[notions]</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior! Your form isn’t equal to mine!” We fought because of arrogance about our forms, and the flavor of the earth disappeared.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc914'>SC 914</a>“‘Then, the earth skin grew, and it’s form, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Once again, we took it and ate, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate it were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>[notions]</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior!

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc915'>SC 915</a>“‘Then, the earth crust grew, becoming a cruder substance, but it’s color, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Once again, we took it and ate, and we lived in the world for a long time. Those that often ate it became cruder in appearance, and those that seldom ate it were still shiny in appearance. Sentient beings held <span class='add'>[notions]</span> of self and other in their minds, and they became arrogant. They said, “My form is superior!

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc916'>SC 916</a>“‘Then, spontaneous rice grew, and it’s color, aroma, and flavor were perfect. Again, we took and ate it. When we gathered it in the morning, it was ripe again by evening. When we gathered it in the evening, and it was ripe again by morning. We would gather it, and it would grow back when we didn’t store what we gathered. It grew chaff and husks when we competed with each other’s stockpiles, and then it didn’t grow back when we gathered it. It turned to withered stalks. Now, we ought to assign fields to houses and make boundaries between the fields.’ They then divide the land into different demarcated fields and assign them to others and themselves.</p>
<h3>Law and Crime Are Invented</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc917'>SC 917</a>“After that, one of them proceeds to store their own rice and steal from other’s fields. When other sentient beings see this, they say, ‘You are a wrongdoer! You are a wrongdoer! Why are you stealing other’s property when you have your own stores and things?’ Then they rebuke them, ‘Don’t ever do that again!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc918'>SC 918</a>“Still, that person doesn’t stop stealing. The other people again rebuke them, ‘You were doing wrong! Why didn’t you stop?’ They then hit the thief with their hand, lead them to an assembly, and tell the assembled people, ‘This person has their own store of rice and stole from another’s field.’</p>
<p>“The thief also says, ‘They hit me!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc919'>SC 919</a>“When they see this happen, the assembled people are saddened and cry. They beat their breasts and say, ‘The world has become evil! How did this evil come about?’ The bonds of sorrow and distress arise, resulting in pain. This is the origin of birth, old age, illness, and death as well as falling to bad destinies. As a result of farmland being divided with boundaries, this fighting happens. No one can decide what brought about these resentments and reprisals. ‘Now, we should designate one equitable chief to safeguard the people, reward those who are good, and punish those who are evil. Our assembly will provide for him to reduce the harm to all of us.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc920'>SC 920</a>“A man was then selected from that assembly who was physically large, handsome in appearance, and imposing in authority. He said to the people, ‘Now, you’ve made me chief to safeguard the people, reward those who are good, and punish those who are evil. You’ve provided for this to reduce the harm to everyone.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc921'>SC 921</a>“Those people listened to him and accepted him as their chief who would reward what should be rewarded and punish what should be punished. It’s then that the name ‘chief of the people’ first comes to be.</p>
<h3>The Lineages of Kings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc922'>SC 922</a>“The first chief of the people had a son named Treasure. Treasure had a son name Superb Flavor.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc923'>SC 923</a>“From the time of Good Intent, there were ten tribes of noble wheel-turning kings whose lineages was continuous and unbroken. The first <span class='add'>[tribe]</span> was named Gaṇotsāha (?), the second was named Uttarapati (?), the third was named Aśmaka, the fourth was named Gandhāra (?), the fifth was named Kaliṅga, the sixth was named Campā, the seventh was named Kuru, the eighth was named Pañcāla, the ninth was named Mithilā, and the tenth was named Ikṣvāku (?).</p>

The Campā kings had fourteen noble wheel-turning kings. The Kuru kings had thirty-one noble wheel-turning kings. The Pañcāla kings had thirty-two noble wheel-turning kings. The Mithilā kings had 84,000 noble wheel-turning kings. The Ikṣvāku kings had 101 noble wheel-turning kings. The last of these kings was named Born From Great Good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc925'>SC 925</a>“That Ikṣvāku king had a son named Aurava (?). Aurava had a son named Gaurava (?). Gaurava had a son named Nipura. Nipura had a son named Siṃhahanu. Siṃhahanu had a son named King Śuddhodana. King Śuddhodana had a son named Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva had a son named Rāhula. As a result of this history, the name ‘kṣatriya’ came to be.</p>
<h3>The Origins of the Four Castes</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc926'>SC 926</a>“At that point, there’s a sentient being who thinks, ‘The homes, families, and various things in the world are all thorns and sores. It would be good to seclude myself from it now. I’ll go to the mountains and practice the path in quietude and contemplation.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc927'>SC 927</a>“He then went far away from the thorns of home to the mountains and lived in quietude. He contemplated under a tree on the mountain and left each day to solicit alms in a village. After the people in the town met him, they treated him with respect and supported him. The people all praised his goodness, ‘This man was able to renounce the ties to home, go to the mountains, and pursue the path. Doing so, he has secluded himself from bad and unskillful things.’ As a result of this praise, he was called ‘brāhmaṇa.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc928'>SC 928</a>“Among the assembly of priests, some weren’t capable of practicing dhyāna. When they left the mountain forests, they would travel among the people and say of themselves, ‘I’m not able to sit in dhyāna.’ As a result of this, they were called ‘priests without dhyāna.’ They would travel down to the villages and do unskillful and poisonous things. As a result, the name ‘poison’ came into being. As a result of these causes, the world came to have the priestly caste.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc929'>SC 929</a>“Among those sentient beings, those who practice various occupations to support themselves arise. As a result, the householder caste arises in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc930'>SC 930</a>“Among those sentient beings, those who practice the arts and crafts to make their living arise. As a result of this, the worker caste arises in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc931'>SC 931</a>“After the Śākya tribe had come into the world, they became the ascetic caste. Among the warrior caste, some people thought to themselves, ‘Worldly love is defiling and impure. What use are these greedy attachments?’ They then abandoned their homes, cut off their hair and beards, put on Dharma robes, and sought the path. <span class='add'>[They said,]</span> ‘I am an ascetic! I am an ascetic!’</p>

<h3>The Arising of Arhats in the World</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc934'>SC 934</a>“Suppose the physical conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct of someone in the warrior assembly isn’t good. After they do things that aren’t good, their bodies break up and their lives end, and they only experience suffering. Suppose the physical conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct of someone in the priestly assembly, householder assembly, or worker assembly isn’t good. After they do things that aren’t good, their bodies break up and their lives end, and they only experience suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc935'>SC 935</a>“If the physical conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct of someone in the warrior assembly is good … they only experience happiness. If the physical conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct of someone in the priestly assembly, householder assembly, or worker assembly is good … they only experience happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc936'>SC 936</a>“Suppose someone in the warrior assembly has both kinds of physical, verbal, and mental conduct. They will experience results of suffering and happiness when their bodies break up and their lives end. Suppose someone in the priestly, householder, and worker assemblies has both kinds of physical, verbal, and mental conduct. They will experience results of suffering and happiness when their bodies break up and their lives end.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc937'>SC 937</a>“Suppose someone in the warrior assembly cuts off their hair and beard, puts on the three-piece Dharma robe, leaves home, and seeks the path. They cultivate the seven factors of awakening, leave home for the path with firm faith, and cultivate the unsurpassed religious life. They realize about themselves in the present life, ‘My births and deaths have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I won’t be subject to another existence.’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc939'>SC 939</a>“Those among these four castes who accomplish the practice of insight become the best of arhats.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc940'>SC 940</a>“Brahmā then says this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “‘Those born of warriors are the best,<br>
Being able to bring together the other castes.<br>
Those who completely accomplish insight,<br>
Are the best among gods and humans!’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc941'>SC 941</a>The Buddha told the monks, “That verse that Brahma says is well spoken, not unskillfully spoken. It’s well put, not unskillfully put. I approve of it. Why is that? Now, I am the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One, and I also say this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “Those born of warriors are the best,<br>
Being able to bring together the other castes.<br>
Those who completely accomplish insight,<br>
Are the best among gods and humans!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc942'>SC 942</a>Thereupon, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
