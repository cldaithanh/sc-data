<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc481'>SC 481</a>“Why is that park called ‘Pāruṣaka Park’? When they enter this park, their bodies become rough. Why is that other park named ‘Citraratha Park’? When they enter this park, their bodies are spontaneously painted with a variety of colors, which delights them. Why is that other park named ‘Miśrakā Park’? On the eighth, tenth, and fifteenth day of every month, attractive females other than female asuras are sent to accompany the gods there. They roam that park and mingle, so it’s called Miśrakā Park. Why is that other park named ‘Nandana Park’? When the gods go to this park, they entertain themselves and rejoice. So, it’s called Nandana.</p>

Up in this hall, they ponder the wonderful Dharma and experience pure happiness, so it’s called Sudharma Hall. Why is that tree named the ‘Pārijāta Tree’? This tree has a spirit named Manda that’s always playing music to entertain itself. Therefore, it’s called Pārijāta. Also, that huge tree spreads its limbs in all four directions, and its flowers and leaves are abundant like great treasure clouds, so it’s called Pārijāta.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc500'>SC 500</a>The Buddha told the monks, “All sentient beings subsist on four kinds of food. What are the four? Physical and fine food is the first, food of contact is the second, food of thought is the third, and food of consciousness is the fourth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc501'>SC 501</a>“Various sentient beings eat different things. People in Jambudvīpa have diverse meals of grains, fish, and meat that serve as their physical food. Clothing and bathes serve as their fine foods. The people of Godānīya and Pūrvavideha also eat diverse meals of grains, fish, and meat that serve as their physical food. Clothing and bathes serve as their fine foods. The people of Uttarakuru only eat spontaneously cooked rice that possesses heavenly flavors that serves as their physical food. Clothing and bathes serve as their fine foods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc502'>SC 502</a>“Nāgas and garuḍas eat tortoises, crocodiles, fish, and turtles that serve as their physical food, and bathes and clothing serve as their fine foods. Asuras eat pure physical food, and bathes and clothing serve as their fine foods. The four god kings, Trāyastriṃśa gods, Yama gods, Tuṣita gods, Nirmāṇarati gods, and Paranirmitavaśavartin gods eat pure physical food, and bathes and clothing serve as their fine foods. The gods above them take the joy and happiness of dhyāna’s samādhi as their food.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc503'>SC 503</a>“What are the sentient beings whose food is contact? Egg-born sentient beings have contact as food. What are the sentient beings whose food is thought? There are sentient beings that subsist because of food of thought. Their faculties grow, and then their lives don’t end. This is food of thought. What are <span class='add'>the sentient beings</span> whose food is consciousness? Sentient beings in hell and the formless realm are called those whose food is consciousness.</p>
<h3>Commerce and Procreation among Sentient Beings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc504'>SC 504</a>“The people of Jambudvīpa use gold, silver, jewels, grain, silk, and workers to generate wealth and make their livings. The people of Godānīya use livestock and gemstones to make an easy living. The people of Pūrvavideha use grain, silk, and gemstones to make an easy living. The people of Uttarakuru make an easy living without any commerce.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc505'>SC 505</a>“The people of Jambudvīpa have courtships, the men marrying the women, who then become wives. The people of Godānīya and Pūrvavideha also have marriage, the men taking the women as wives. The people of Uttarakuru don’t have marriage, nor do men take women as wives. Nāgas, garuḍas, and asuras have marriage, the males taking the females as wives. The four god kings, Trāyastriṃśa gods … Paranirmitavaśavartin gods also have marriage, the males taking females as wives. Above those heavens, there aren’t any males or females.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc506'>SC 506</a>“The men and women of Jambudvīpa have sexual intercourse with the physical contact of their male and female organs. The people of Godānīya, Pūrvavideha, and Uttarakuru also do so with the physical contact of their male and female organs. Nāgas and garuḍas have sexual intercourse with the physical contact of their male and female organs.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc507'>SC 507</a>“Asuras have sexual intercourse by exchanging energy between their male and female organs while in close proximity to each other. The four god kings and Trāyastriṃśa gods are likewise. The Yama gods have sexual intercourse by being close to each other. The Tuṣita gods have sexual intercourse by holding hands. The Nirmāṇarati gods have sexual intercourse by looking passionately at each other. The Paranirmitavaśavartin gods have sexual intercourse by glancing at each other. Above those heavens, there’s no more sexual desire.</p>

<h3>Birth among the Four God Kings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc512'>SC 512</a>“Sometimes, a sentient being commits good physical deeds, speaks good words, and thinks good thoughts. When their body breaks up and their life ends, they are born among the four god kings. Their final consciousness ceases here, and an initial consciousness arises among the four god kings. Because of that consciousness, they have name and form. Because of that name and form, they have the six senses.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc513'>SC 513</a>“When those gods are first born, they’re like one- or two-year-old human children. They spontaneous appear sitting on a god’s knee. That god then says, ‘This is my child!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc514'>SC 514</a>“As a reward for their conduct, knowledge spontaneously arises in them. They think to themselves, ‘What was the conduct that caused me to be born here now?’ Then they also think, ‘I was once among humans and did good physical deeds, spoke good words, and had good thoughts. It was because of this conduct that I’ve been born as a god now. If my life were to end and I were born again among humans, I would be physically, verbally, and mentally pure. I’d redouble my efforts and cultivate these good conducts.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc515'>SC 515</a>“Not long after the child’s birth, they realize that they’re hungry. A treasure bowl then spontaneously appears in front of the child, which is full of spontaneously pure food with a hundred heavenly flavors. If the child has much merit, the food’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the food’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the food’s color is red. The child then takes the food and puts it in their mouth, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc516'>SC 516</a>“When the child is finished eating, they realize that they’re thirsty. A treasure bowl spontaneously appears that’s filled with ambrosia. If the child has much merit, the ambrosia’s color is white. If the child’s merit is average, then the ambrosia’s color is blue. If the child’s merit is inferior, then the ambrosia’s color is red. The child picks up the ambrosia and drinks it, and it’s spontaneously digested like butter thrown into a fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc517'>SC 517</a>“After the child finishes eating and drinking, their body grows larger until it’s equal to that of other gods. That god then goes into a pool to bathe, washing and enjoying themselves. After enjoying themselves there, the god emerges from the pool and stands under a perfume tree. The perfume tree bends down, and they take many fragrances to rub on their body.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc518'>SC 518</a>“Again, the god goes to a clothing tree. The tree bends down, and they take various clothes to wear.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc523'>SC 523</a>“Again, the god goes to a musical instrument tree. The tree bends down, and they take heavenly instruments. With wondrous voices in harmony with the music, they go to forest parks. Seeing countless goddesses singing and playing drums, they smile and chat with them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc524'>SC 524</a>“When those gods go sightseeing, they become defiled and attached. They look east and forget what’s west, or they look west and forget what’s east. When they’re first born, they thought to themselves, ‘What was the conduct that caused me to be born here now?’ But when they go sightseeing, they forget all about that, and the attractive goddesses attend to them.</p>
<h3>Birth among the Trāyastriṃśa Gods</h3>

<h3>The Three Fasting Days</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc535'>SC 535</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are three fasts during a half month. What are the three? The eighth day is a fasting day, the fourteenth day is a fasting day, and the fifteenth day is a fasting day. These are the three fasts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc536'>SC 536</a>“Why is there a fast on the eighth day of the month? Every eighth day of the month, the four god kings tell their servants, ‘Go check on the conduct of the world. Examine the multitude of people. Are they dutiful to their parents? Do they respect the ascetics and priests? Do they honor and serve their elders? Do they observe the fasting rules, give offerings, and aid the poor?’</p>

After they’ve examined them, they see that the world’s people aren’t dutiful to their parents, don’t respect the ascetics and priests, don’t honor or serve their elders, and don’t observe the fasting rules, give offerings, or aid the poor. They return to the kings and say, ‘Heavenly Kings, those in the world who are dutiful to their parents, honor their elders, cultivate the fasting rules purely, give offerings, and aid the poor are very few. Very few, indeed!’</p>

<h3>Śakra’s Verse Praising the Fasts</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc552'>SC 552</a>“Lord Śakra then wants the gods rejoice twice as much, so he speaks this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p> “‘Every month on the eighth day<br>

Will become my equals!’”</p>

<h3>Yakṣa Spirits that Inhabit the Earth</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc556'>SC 556</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The homes, dwellings, and buildings of all people have yakṣa spirits. None are empty of them. Yakṣa spirits are in all avenues, streets, intersections, butcher shops, markets, and graveyards. None are empty of them. All those yakṣa spirits are named for their places of refuge. They’re named for the people, towns, cities, countries, lands, mountains, and rivers in which they take refuge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc557'>SC 557</a>The Buddha told the monks, “All trees, even the smallest of them that are the size of wheel hubs, have yakṣa spirits who take refuge in them. None of them are empty. All men and women when they are first born have yakṣa spirits who protect them. At the time of their death, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc558'>SC 558</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Suppose there are practitioners from other religions who ask, ‘Gentlemen, suppose that all men and women have yakṣa spirits who follow them as protectors from when they are first born. When they’re about to die, those guardian yakṣa spirits take their spirits, and then they die. Why are there yakṣa spirits who harass people, or are there no yakṣa spirits who harass people?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc559'>SC 559</a>“Supposing someone asks this question, you should answer in this way, ‘Worldly people do things contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There may be only one yakṣa spirit for every hundred or thousand of these people, just as a herd of a hundred or a thousand cattle or sheep has only one a person tending it. Those yakṣa spirits are likewise for people who act contrary to the Dharma, become deluded by wrong views, and commit the ten bad deeds. There’s only one spirit guarding a hundred or a thousand of those people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc560'>SC 560</a>“Suppose there are people who practice the good Dharma, who’s views are correct and act according to their belief, and who perfect the ten good deeds. One such person has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them, just as the king or a king’s minister has a hundred or a thousand people guarding them. They are likewise. A single person who practices the good Dharma and perfects the ten good deeds has a hundred or a thousand spirits protecting them. As a result of this, some worldly people are harassed by yakṣa spirits, and some are not harassed by them.”</p>

<h3>The Spirits of the Four Gross Elements</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc580'>SC 580</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are spirits of the four gross elements. What are the four? First is the earth spirit, second is the water spirit, third is the wind spirit, and fourth is the fire spirit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc581'>SC 581</a>“Once, the earth spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no water, fire, or wind in earth.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc582'>SC 582</a>“Knowing that the earth spirit had this thought, I went to her and said, ‘Did you have this thought, “There’s no water, fire, or wind in earth”?’</p>
<p>“The earth spirit replied, ‘There really is no water, fire, or wind in earth.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc583'>SC 583</a>“I then said, ‘Don’t have this thought that there’s no water, fire, or wind in earth. Why is that? There’s water, fire, and wind in earth. It’s only because there’s much more earth present that it’s called the earth element.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc584'>SC 584</a>The Buddha told the monks, “That time I spoke with the earth spirit, I successively taught her the Dharma, removed her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her. I discussed generosity, precepts, how to be born in heaven, that desire is impure, and the trouble of the higher contaminants. <span class='add'>I praised</span> escaping <span class='add'>desire</span> as the <span class='add'>most subtle, pure, and</span> supreme thing. I broadly explained and revealed the pure religious life to her. I then knew that her mind was pure, gentle, gladdened, devoid of the hindrances, and easy to teach. According to the eternal way of buddhas, I taught the noble truth of suffering and the truths of suffering’s formation, suffering’s cessation, and suffering’s escape. I explained them broadly for her.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc585'>SC 585</a>“The earth spirit became removed from dust and free of defilement right there on her seat, and her vision of the Dharma was purified. The earth spirit was like white cloth that readily accepts a dye. Her faith was purified, and she attained the Dharma eye without any doubts. Seeing the Dharma with certainty, she didn’t fall to the unpleasant destinies, nor did she set out on some other path. Achieving fearlessness, she said to me, ‘I now take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the Dharma, and take refuge in the Saṅgha. I won’t kill, steal, engage in sex, lie, or drink alcohol for the rest of my life. Permit me to become an laywoman in the correct Dharma.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc586'>SC 586</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the water spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no earth, fire, or wind in water.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc587'>SC 587</a>“Knowing that the water spirit had this view, the earth spirit went to her and said, ‘Did this view really occur to you, “There’s no earth, fire, or wind in water”?’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc588'>SC 588</a>“The earth spirit then said, ‘Don’t have this view that there’s no earth, fire, or wind in water. Why is that? There’s earth, fire, and wind in water. It’s only because there’s much more water present that it’s called the water element.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc589'>SC 589</a>The Buddha told the monks, “The earth spirit taught the Dharma for the water spirit, removing her bad view by teaching, instructing, profiting, and delighting her.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc591'>SC 591</a>The Buddha told the monks, “Once, the fire spirit had a bad view. She said, ‘There’s no earth, water, or wind in fire.’</p>

<h3>On Clouds, Lightning, and Rain</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc601'>SC 601</a>The Buddha told the monks, “There are four kinds of clouds. What are the four? The first is white-colored, the second is black-colored, the third is red-colored, and the fourth is crimson-colored. The white clouds have a large amount of earth element in them. The black clouds have a large amount of water element in them. The red clouds have a large among of fire element in them. The crimson clouds have a large among of wind element in them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc602'>SC 602</a>“Those clouds are sometimes five kilometers, ten kilometers, fifteen kilometers, twenty kilometers … 2,000 kilometers away from the Earth. The exception is right after the eon begins when the clouds go up to the Ābhāsvara Heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc603'>SC 603</a>“Lightning has four kinds. What are the four? Eastern lightning, which is called Body Light. Southern lightning, which is called Hard to Destroy. Western lightning, which is called Streaming Fire. Northern lightning, which is called Fixed Illumination.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc604'>SC 604</a>“Why are there these lightning flashes in the clouds and sky? Sometimes, Body Light and Hard to Destroy touch each other. Sometimes Body Light and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes the Body Light and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Stream of Fire touch each other. Sometimes Hard to Destroy and Fixed Illumination touch each other. Sometimes Stream of Fire and Fixed Illumination touch each other. These are the reasons that there are lightning flashes in the sky and clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc605'>SC 605</a>“Again, why does the sound of thunder happen in the sky and clouds? Sometimes, the earth and water elements come into contact in the sky. Sometimes, the earth and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the earth and wind elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and fire elements come into contact. Sometimes, the water and wind elements come into contact. These are the reasons the sound of thunder happens in the sky and clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc606'>SC 606</a>“There are five causes and conditions that make predicting rain uncertain and confuse forecasters. What are the five? First, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the clouds are baked by too much fire element and don’t release rain. This is the first reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc607'>SC 607</a>“Second, the clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, a great wind rises that scatters the clouds in all four directions, blowing them into the mountains. This is the <span class='add'>second</span> reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc608'>SC 608</a>“Third, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, a great asura approaches, disperses the clouds, and sends them over the ocean. This is the <span class='add'>third</span> reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc609'>SC 609</a>“Fourth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the master of clouds and master of rain are careless and lustful, so they never release the rain. This is the <span class='add'>fourth</span> reason forecasters are mistaken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc610'>SC 610</a>“Fifth, clouds may have thunder and lightning, and a forecaster says it will rain. However, the world’s population behaves contrary to the Dharma. They carelessly do impure deeds, and they are stingy, jealous, and hold deluded views. This causes the heavens not to release its rain. This is the <span class='add'>fifth</span> reason forecasters are mistaken. These are the five causes and conditions for forecasters to be uncertain about rain.</p>
