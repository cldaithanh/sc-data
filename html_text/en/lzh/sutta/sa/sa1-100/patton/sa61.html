<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “There are five acquired aggregates. What are the five? They are the acquired aggregate of form … feeling … conception … volition … and the acquired aggregate of awareness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What is the acquired aggregate of form? Whatever forms there, they are all the four basic elements or forms made of the four basic elements. This is called the acquired aggregate of form.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Furthermore, that form is impermanent, painful, and subject to change. If one stops that acquired aggregate of form forever without remainder, finally abandons it, completely destroys it, and becomes free of desire for it, it’ll become tranquil and disappear. No remaining acquired aggregate of form will continue, arise, or be produced. This is called sublime. This is called peace. This is called abandoning all remaining cravings completely, having no desire, being completely ceased, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“What is the acquired aggregate of feeling? That is the group of six feelings. What are the six? They are feelings that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … feelings that arise from mental contact. This is called the acquired aggregate of feeling.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Furthermore, that acquired aggregate of feeling is impermanent, painful, and subject to change … <em>up to</em> … being completely ceased, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“What is the acquired aggregate of conception? That is the group of six conceptions. What are the six? They are conceptions that arise from visual contact … <em>up to</em> … conceptions that arise from mental contact. This is called the acquired aggregate of conception.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Furthermore, that acquired aggregate of conception is impermanent, painful, and subject to change … <em>up to</em> … being completely ceased, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“What is the acquired aggregate of volition? That is the group of six intentions. What are the six? They are intentions that arise from visual contact … <em>up to</em> … intentions that arise from mental contact. This is called the acquired aggregate of volition.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Furthermore, that acquired aggregate of volition is impermanent, painful, and subject to change … <em>up to</em> … being completely ceased, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“What is the acquired aggregate of awareness? That is the body of six types of awareness. What are the six? They are the group of visual awareness … <em>up to</em> … group of mental awareness. This is called the acquired aggregate of awareness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Furthermore, that acquired aggregate of awareness is impermanent, painful, and subject to change … <em>up to</em> … being completely ceased, and <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Monks, if these principles are contemplated, investigated, discerned, and accepted with wisdom, this is called the practice that follows belief. Leaping higher, one becomes free of birth and goes beyond the ground of ordinary men. If they’ve yet to attain the fruit of stream entry and don’t die in the meantime, they will surely attain that fruit of stream entry.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Monks, if these principles are contemplated, investigated, and accepted with higher wisdom, this is called the practice that follows Dharma. Leaping higher, one becomes free of birth and goes beyond the ground of ordinary men. If they’ve yet to attain the fruit of stream entry and don’t die in the meantime, they will surely attain that fruit of stream entry.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Monks, when these principles are fully seen with true and correct wisdom, one will know that the three bonds are completely cut. They are personality view, holding to precepts, and doubt. Monks, this is called the fruit of stream entry. One won’t fall to bad destinies, and they’re certain to be correctly headed toward complete awakening. They will have seven more births as gods or humans and afterward reach the final end of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Monks, if these principles are fully seen with true and correct wisdom, and someone’s mind doesn’t produce contaminants, they are called an <em>arhat</em>. Their contaminants have been ended, and their task has been accomplished. They have set down the heavy burden and won their own reward. They’ve ended the bonds to existence, and their minds have been liberated with proper knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
