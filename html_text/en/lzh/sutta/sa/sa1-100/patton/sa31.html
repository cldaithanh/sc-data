<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: The Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. At the time, Venerable Śāriputra was on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>There was then a prominent man’s son named Śroṇa who went for walks every day. He went to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and visited Venerable Śāriputra there. After bowing at his feet, Śroṇa withdrew to sit at one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Śāriputra said, “Śroṇa, suppose ascetics or priests don’t truly know form, don’t truly know the formation of form, don’t truly know the cessation of form, and don’t truly know the path to the cessation of form. Śroṇa, you should know that these ascetics or priests aren’t capable of stopping form. In this way, suppose ascetics or priests don’t truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness, don’t truly know the formation of awareness, don’t truly know the cessation of awareness, and don’t truly know the path to the cessation of awareness. <span class='add'>[Śroṇa, you should know that these ascetics or priests]</span> aren’t capable of stopping awareness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Śroṇa, suppose ascetics or priests do truly know form, truly know the formation of form, truly know the cessation of form, and truly know the path to the cessation of form. Therefore, Śroṇa, you should know that these ascetics or priests are capable of stopping form. In this way, Śroṇa, suppose ascetics or priests do truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness, do truly know the formation of awareness, truly know the cessation of awareness, and truly know the path to the cessation of awareness. Śroṇa, you should know that these ascetics or priests are capable of stopping awareness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Śroṇa, what do you think? Is form permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>He replied, “Impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Śāriputra asked, “If something is impermanent, is that painful?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>He replied, “It’s painful.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Śāriputra asked, “If form is impermanent and painful, it’s subject to change. Would a noble disciple see form as self, different than self, or either being present in the other?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>He replied, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Śroṇa, in this way, is feeling … conception … volition … awareness permanent or impermanent?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>He replied, “Impermanent.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>He further asked, “If something is impermanent, is it painful?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>He replied, “It’s painful.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Śāriputra asked, “If <span class='add'>[awareness]</span> is impermanent and painful, then it’s subject to change. Would a noble disciple see awareness as self, different than self, or either being present in the other?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>He replied, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Śroṇa, you should know that whether forms are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, all those forms are not self, not different than self, and neither is present in the other. This is called truly knowing them. Śroṇa, a noble disciple who becomes disillusioned with form, becomes free of desire for it, and is liberated from it is freed from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Thus, whether feelings … conceptions … volitions … instances of awareness are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, all those instances of awareness are not self, not different than self, and neither is present in the other. This is called truly knowing them. Śroṇa, a noble disciple who becomes disillusioned with awareness, becomes free of desire for it, and is liberated from it is freed from birth, old age, illness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, and trouble.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>When Śroṇa heard what Śāriputra taught, he rejoiced and celebrated. He then bowed and departed.</p>
