<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, the heavenly spirits Sātāgiri and Haimavata made this promise to each other: “If a treasure appears in one of our palaces, we must tell the other about it. If one doesn’t tell the other, then they’re guilty of breaking the promise.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then, while Haimavata was in his palace, an unprecedented and precious lotus flower appeared. That flower had a thousand petals, was the size of a cartwheel, and had a precious golden stem.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The spirit Haimavata then sent a messenger to tell Sātāgiri, “Village chief, an unprecedented and precious lotus flower has suddenly appeared in my palace. That flower has a thousand petals, is the size of a cartwheel, and has a precious golden stem. Come and look at it!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>A messenger sent by the spirit Sātāgiri came to Haimavata’s home to tell him, “Village chief, what use would a hundred thousand of these lotus flowers be? An unprecedented and great precious lotus flower has appeared in my palace now. That is, the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who is wise in conduct, well gone, an understander of the world, an unsurpassed man, a trainer of men, a teacher of gods and people, and a <em>buddha</em> <em>bhagavān</em>. You can come render service and give offerings to him!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Haimavata then came to visit Sātāgiri with five hundred followers. He asked him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“On this auspicious fifteenth day,<br>
We gladly meet this divine night.<br>
I must ask, what sabbath did you accept,<br>
And from what Arhat did you receive it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Today, the Buddha, the Bhagavān,<br>
Is in the great kingdom of Magadha.<br>
He is staying at Rājagṛha there,<br>
In the Kalandaka Bamboo Park.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>He expounds upon the sublime Dharma<br>
That removes the suffering of beings.<br>
The pain of suffering, its formation,<br>
And its cessation he fully realized.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The noble eightfold path escapes suffering<br>
And safely arrives at <em>nirvāṇa</em>.<br>
You ought to go and give some offering<br>
To that Arhat, that Bhagavān, of mine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Haimavata asked in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Does he possess a wish for happiness,<br>
To rescue sentient beings with kindness?<br>
Does he accept some and not others,<br>
Or are his perceptions of them the same?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“A sublime wish is his thought of kindness<br>
To set free every sentient being.<br>
When it comes to accepting them or not,<br>
His perceptions of them are all the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Haimavata then asked in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Has he perfected a thorough insight,<br>
And is he accomplished in his practice?<br>
His contaminants forever destroyed,<br>
Will he not have a later existence?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>

His contaminants forever destroyed,<br>
He will not have a later existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>Haimavata then asked in verse:</p>

And his physical and verbal actions?<br>
Are his insight and conduct perfected?<br>
Is he commended with the Dharma?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class='gatha'>

And he is commended with the Dharma.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>Haimavata then asked in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Does he avoid hurting living beings,<br>
And does he not take something not given?<br>
Does he stay far away from carelessness,<br>
And does he not avoid meditation?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“He doesn’t ever hurt sentient beings,<br>
Doesn’t wrongly take what isn’t given.<br>
He does stay far away from carelessness,<br>
And meditates constantly, day and night.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>Haimavata then asked in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Does he not delight in the five desires?<br>
Does his mind not go undisturbed?<br>
Has he purified his Dharma vision,<br>
And is he fully rid of foolishness?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“His thoughts never delight in the desires,<br>
And his mind is devoid of disturbances.<br>
The Buddha’s Dharma vision is pure,<br>
And he has no remaining foolishness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>Haimavata then asked in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Is he honest, doesn’t speaking falsely?<br>
Does he make use of no abusive words?<br>
Does he speak without causing divisions?<br>
Does he speak without being dishonest?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>Sātāgiri then replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“What he says is honest, it isn’t false,<br>
And there are no abusive words in it.<br>

Always speaking in accord with Dharma.”</p>

Has he perfected full liberation<br>
And the wisdom of a Tathāgata?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“He has perfected all the pure precepts;<br>
He is rightly mindful, always at peace.<br>
He has accomplished full liberation<br>
And gained the Tathāgata’s great wisdom.”</p>

What contaminants has he ended?<br>
Will he receive a later existence?”</p>

So let us give praise to his Dharma.”</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Possessing calves like an antelope deer<br>
Is a superior sign of a sage.<br>
Eating little and abandoning greed,<br>
This sage meditates living in a grove.<br>
Let us now go there together<br>
And pay homage to that Gautama!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>Surrounded by a following of a hundred thousand <em>yakṣa</em> spirits, Sātāgiri and Haimavata then went to the Buddha, paid homage to him, and gave offerings. They then adjusted their robes to bare their right shoulders, saluted him with their palms together, and said this in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Possessing calves like an antelope deer<br>
Is a superior sign of a sage.<br>
Eating little and abandoning greed,<br>
This sage meditates living in a grove.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>

To make a request of Gautama,<br>
Who is a lion that wanders alone,<br>
Who is a great <em>nāga</em> who has no fear.</p>

Hoping that the sage will settle our doubts.<br>
How do we find escape from suffering?<br>
How is one freed from suffering?<br>
Please explain liberation for us.<br>
What is it that ceases suffering?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>The Bhagavān then answered them in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“There’s the world’s five merits of desire<br>
And a sixth that’s said to be the mind.<br>
Have no greed for those desires,<br>
And you’ll be freed from all suffering.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“This is the way to escape suffering<br>
And the way to be freed from suffering.<br>
Now, I have answered your question:<br>
This is what ceases suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>Both Sātāgiri and Haimavata again asked the Buddha in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“How does one turn back from the source,<br>
And not turn to an unpleasant path?<br>
How does one bring an total end<br>
To all the world’s pleasures and pains?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>The Bhagavān answered them in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“By completely ending the senses of<br>
Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,<br>
As well as their names and forms,<br>
Forever and without remainder.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Turning back from those sources<br>
Doesn’t turn toward those pathways.<br>
Afterward, <span class='add'>[all the world’s]</span> pleasure and pain<br>
Is completely gone without remainder.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>Sātāgiri and Haimavata again questioned the Buddha in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“How many things give rise to the world?<br>
How many things combine in the world?<br>
How many things take hold of the world?<br>
How many things make the world cease?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>The Bhagavān answered them in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Six things give rise to the world;<br>
Six things combine in the world;<br>
Six things take hold of the world;<br>
And six things get rid of the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>Sātāgiri and Haimavata again questioned the Buddha in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“How does one cross over all the floods?<br>
By what diligent method done day and night,<br>
Neither clambering nor standing in place,<br>
Does one avoid drowning in deep water?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>The Bhagavān answered them in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“By perfecting all the precepts<br>
With skillful wisdom and attainment<br>
And contemplating with fixed attention:<br>
This is the way to cross the deep water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Not enjoying perceptions of desire<br>
And going beyond the bonds of form,<br>
One neither clambers nor stands in place,<br>
And they don’t drown in the deep water.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>Sātāgiri and Haimavata again questioned the Buddha in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“What principle crosses all the floods?<br>
With what does one cross the ocean?<br>
How does one rid themselves of suffering?<br>
How do they become purified?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>The Bhagavān answered them in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“It’s confidence that crosses the river.<br>
With carefulness does one cross the ocean.<br>
With diligence, one can end suffering.<br>
It’s with wisdom that one is purified.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>The Bhagavān then spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“You can question someone else<br>
About the way of ascetics and priests.<br>
The real gift is discipline;<br>
Aside from this, there’s no other Dharma.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>Haimavata again spoke these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“What else is there to ask<br>
About the way of an ascetic or priest?<br>
One with great diligence today<br>
Has become a skillful leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Now, I will repay that<br>
Sātāgiri for the favor he did.<br>
He has served as an able guide<br>
