  <h1>The River Torrent</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Take the example of a river produced by a mountain torrent. Its water is deep and fast moving. The current flows violently, and many things bob up and down in it. Both shores of that river have a mixture of reeds and trees growing on them. They form a bridge that leans across that large river from its shores. When a group of people attempt to ford the river there, many are carried away by the water, following the current until they disappear. When a wave pushes them near the shore, they grab at the reeds and trees, but the reeds and trees break, and they continue floating down the river.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“In this way, monks, if ordinary, foolish sentient beings don’t truly know form … the formation of form … cessation of form … enjoyment of form … trouble of form … don’t truly know the escape from form, they will delight in form, saying: ‘Form is myself.’ That form subsequently breaks. In the same way, they don’t truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness … the formation of awareness … cessation of awareness, enjoyment of awareness, trouble of awareness … don’t truly know the escape from awareness. Because they don’t truly know it, they delight in awareness. They say, ‘Awareness is myself.’ That awareness will also subsequently break.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“If a well-versed noble disciple truly knows form … the formation of form … cessation of form … enjoyment of form … trouble of form … truly knows the escape from form, then they won’t delight in form. Truly knowing feeling … conception … volition … awareness … the formation of awareness … cessation of awareness … enjoyment of awareness … trouble of awareness … truly knowing the escape from awareness, they don’t delight in awareness. Because they don’t delight in it, they will themselves know the attainment of <em>parinirvāṇa</em>: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”</p>
