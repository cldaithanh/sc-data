<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: The Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. At the time, Venerable Śāriputra and Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila were on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Venerable Kauṣṭhila rose from meditation in the afternoon and visited Śāriputra. Once they had exchanged greetings and joked in various ways, he withdrew to sit to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila said to Śāriputra, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you might have some time to explain it for me?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Śāriputra said, “Go ahead with your question, sir. I will tell you what I know.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila said to Śāriputra, “There’s the term ‘ignorance.’ What is ignorance? Who possesses this ignorance?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Śāriputra replied, “Ignorance means to not know. Someone who doesn’t know is ignorant.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“What is it that they don’t know?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“It’s that form is impermanent. They truly don’t know that form is impermanent. Form is something that erodes. They truly don’t know that form is something that erodes. Form is something that arises and ceases. They truly don’t know that form is something that arises and ceases. Feeling … conception … volition … awareness <span class='add'>[is impermanent.]</span> They truly don’t know that awareness is impermanent. Awareness is something that erodes. They truly don’t know that awareness is something that erodes. Awareness is something that arises and ceases. They truly don’t know that awareness is something that arises and ceases. Mahākauṣṭhila, they truly don’t know these five acquired aggregates. They don’t see and have no direct realization of them. They are foolish, benighted, and aren’t insightful. This is called ignorance. Someone who achieves this is called ignorant.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Mahākauṣṭhila asked, “Śāriputra, there’s that term ‘insight.’ What is insight? Who possesses this insight?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Śāriputra said, “Mahākauṣṭhila, the term insight means to know. Someone who knows is called insightful.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Mahākauṣṭhila asked, “What is it that they know?”</p>

Kauṣṭhila, they truly know these five acquired aggregates. They see and have insight about them. They are aware, wise, and directly realize it. This is called insight. Someone who achieves this is called insightful.”</p>
