<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: The Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha. At the time, Venerable Śāriputra and Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila were on Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila rose from meditation in the afternoon and visited Śāriputra. Once they had exchanged greetings and joked in various ways, he withdrew to sit to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila said to Śāriputra, “I have a question I’d like to ask if you might have some time to explain it for me?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Śāriputra said, “Go ahead with your question, sir. I will tell you what I know.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Venerable Mahākauṣṭhila asked Śāriputra, “There’s the term ‘ignorance.’ What is this ignorance? Who possesses this ignorance?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Śāriputra replied, “To not know is ignorance. <span class='add'>[Someone who doesn’t know is ignorant.]</span>”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“What don’t they know?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“They don’t truly know form … the formation of form … the cessation of form … the enjoyment of form … the trouble of form, and they don’t truly know the escape from form. They don’t truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness … the formation of awareness … the cessation of awareness … the enjoyment of awareness … the trouble of awareness, and they don’t truly know the escape from awareness. Mahākauṣṭhila, they truly don’t know these five acquired aggregates. They don’t truly see and have no direct realization of them. They are benighted, foolish, <span class='add'>[and aren’t insightful.]</span> This is called ignorance. Someone who achieves this is called ignorant.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Mahākauṣṭhila also asked, “Śāriputra, what is insight? Who possesses this insight?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Śāriputra said, “<span class='add'>[Mahākauṣṭhila, the term insight means to know.]</span> Someone who knows is called insightful.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“What is it that they know?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>Śāriputra said, “They truly know form … the formation of form … the cessation of form … the enjoyment of form … the trouble of form, and they truly know the escape from form. They truly know feeling … conception … volition … awareness … the formation of awareness … the cessation of awareness … the enjoyment of awareness … the trouble of awareness, and they truly know the escape from awareness. Mahākauṣṭhila, they truly know these five acquired aggregates. They truly see and have insight about them. They are aware, wise, and directly realize it. This is called insight. Someone who achieves this is called insightful.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>When those two proper gentlemen each heard that teaching, they rejoiced and departed.</p>
