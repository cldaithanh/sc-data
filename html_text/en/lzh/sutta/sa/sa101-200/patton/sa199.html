  <h1>Rāhula (9-16)</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed Rāhula, “How do you know and see <span class='add'>[49]</span> this body of awareness … <span class='add'>[50]</span> the outer sense fields of forms, sounds, odors, flavors, touches, and ideas … <span class='add'>[51]</span> visual awareness … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and mental awareness … <span class='add'>[52]</span> visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and mental contact … <span class='add'>[53]</span> feelings that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and feelings that arise from mental contact … <span class='add'>[54]</span> notions that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and notions that arise from mental contact … <span class='add'>[55]</span> intentions that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and intentions that arise from mental contact … <span class='add'>[56]</span> cravings that arise from visual contact … auditory … olfactory … gustatory … somatic … and cravings that arise from mental contact and all external signs without having any binding attachments to self, what belongs to self, and the tendency of self pride?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Rāhula said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma root, the Dharma eye, and the Dharma basis. It would be good, Bhagavān, if you would give a detailed discourse on this subject for the monks! After they hear it, the monks will accept and approve of it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha told Rāhula, “Good! Listen closely; I will explain it for you. Whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, distant or near, whatever eyes that exist <em>and so on</em> are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other when truly and correctly observed. Rāhula, <em>the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind and so on are likewise</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Rāhula, when you know and see this conscious body <em>and so on</em> and all external signs in this way, binding attachments to self, what belongs to self, and the tendency of self pride won’t arise. Rāhula, such a monk goes beyond both <span class='add'>[of these internal and external signs]</span>. Being free of these signs, he is tranquil and liberated. Rāhula, such a monk eliminates the craving of desires, turns away from the bonds, and reaches the final end of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><em>As with the inner senses, the outer senses … up to … cravings that arise from mental contact are also thus explained in full.</em></p>
