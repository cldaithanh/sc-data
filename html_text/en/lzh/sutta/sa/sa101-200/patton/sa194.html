  <h1>Delight in Suffering</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone’s delight arises from the eye, then their delight arises from suffering. If someone’s delight arises from suffering, I say they are not liberated from suffering. If someone’s delight arises from the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, then their delight arises from suffering. If someone’s delight arises from suffering, I say they are not liberated from suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, if someone’s delight doesn’t arise from the eye, then their delight doesn’t arise from suffering. If someone’s delight doesn’t arise from suffering, I say they are liberated from suffering. If someone’s delight doesn’t arise from the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, then their delight doesn’t arise from suffering. If someone’s delight doesn’t arise from suffering, I say they are liberated from suffering.”</p>
