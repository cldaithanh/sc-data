<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Supposing that a monk will know the noble truth of suffering, then he will understand <span class='add'>[suffering]</span> … will know the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he will end <span class='add'>[its formation]</span> … will know the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he will realize <span class='add'>[its cessation]</span> … will know the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he will cultivate <span class='add'>[that path]</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
