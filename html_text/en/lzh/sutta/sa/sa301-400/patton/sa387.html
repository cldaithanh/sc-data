  <h1>The Four Noble Truths (8)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood <span class='add'>[suffering]</span> … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended <span class='add'>[its formation]</span> … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized <span class='add'>[its cessation]</span> … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated <span class='add'>[that path]</span>. In this way, that monk has no barred gate, has leveled off the city moat, and has crossed the dangerous heights. <span class='add'>[Liberated from bondage,]</span> he’s called a noble one who has planted the noble flag.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, how does he have no barred gate? It means that he has ended the five lower bonds and has known it. This is called being free of the barred gate. How has he leveled off the city moat? Ignorance is known as the deep moat. He brings it to an end and knows it. This is called leveling off the city moat. How has he crossed the dangerous heights? It means birth and death without end and reaching the final end of suffering. This is called crossing the dangerous heights. How is he liberated from bondage? It means he has ended craving and has known it. How does he plant the noble flag? It means he has ended self pride and has known it. This is called planting the noble flag.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
