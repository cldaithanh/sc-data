  <h1>The Four Noble Truths (5)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Residence of Sages in the Deer Preserve of Bārāṇasī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are four noble truths. What are the four? They are the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If a monk has known the noble truth of suffering, then he has understood <span class='add'>[suffering]</span> … has known the noble truth of suffering’s formation, then he has ended <span class='add'>[its formation]</span> … has known the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, then he has realized <span class='add'>[its cessation]</span> … has known the noble truth of the path to suffering’s cessation, then he has cultivated <span class='add'>[that path]</span>. In this way, that monk is called an <em>arhat</em>. His contaminants have ended, his task has been accomplished, he’s free of the heavy burdens, and he has won his own reward. Having ended the bonds of existence, he’s well liberated with right knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
