<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Suppose an ascetic or priest conceives about earth that there is earth: ‘Earth is the soul, earth belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to earth.’ Having supposed that earth is the soul, they do not know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … They conceive about purity that there is purity: ‘Purity is the soul, purity belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to purity.’ Having supposed that purity is the soul, they do not know purity … the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … They conceive about everything that there is everything. ‘Everything is the soul, everything belongs to the soul, or the soul belongs to everything.’ Having supposed that everything is the soul, they don’t know everything.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Suppose an ascetic or priest knows about earth that it’s earth: ‘Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.’ Not supposing that earth is a soul, they know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … They know about purity that it’s purity: ‘Purity isn’t a soul, purity doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to purity.’ Not supposing that purity is a soul, they know purity… the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … They know about everything that it’s everything: ‘Everything isn’t a soul, everything doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to everything.’ Not supposing that everything is a soul, they know everything.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“I know about earth that it’s earth: ‘Earth isn’t a soul, earth doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to earth.’ Not supposing that earth is a soul, I know earth. So it is with water … fire … air … spirits … gods … Prajāpati … Brahmā … Avṛha … Atapa … I know about purity that it’s purity: ‘Purity isn’t a soul, purity doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to purity.’ Not supposing that purity is a soul, I know purity … the abode of measureless space … abode of measureless awareness … abode of nothingness … abode neither with nor without conception … oneness … distinction … diversity … what’s seen … heard … discerned … known … found … investigated … mental thought … mental intention … from this world to that world … from that world to this world … I know about everything that it’s everything: ‘Everything isn’t a soul, everything doesn’t belong to a soul, and the soul doesn’t belong to everything.’ Not supposing that everything is a soul, I know everything.”</p>
