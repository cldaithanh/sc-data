<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the priest Agrahana went for a walkabout in the afternoon. He paid the Buddha a visit, exchanging greetings with him and withdrawing to sit at one side. He said, “Gautama, I have a question I would like to ask if you would permit me.”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān told him, “You may ask your question.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The priest asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the priestly scriptures?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the priestly scriptures is humanity.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The priest also asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of humanity?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of humanity is grain.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of grain?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of grain is the earth.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the earth?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the earth is water.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of water?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of air?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of air is space.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of space?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “Space has no basis. It’s only because of the sun and moon that there is space.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the sun and moon?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the sun and moon is the Heaven of the Four Kings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Heaven of the Four Kings?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Heaven of the Four Kings is the Trayastriṃśa Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Trayastriṃśa Heaven?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Trayastriṃśa Heaven is the Yama Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Yama Heaven?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Yama Heaven is the Tuṣita Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Tuṣita Heaven?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Tuṣita Heaven is the Nirmāṇarati Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Nirmāṇarati Heaven is the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Paranirmāṇarati Heaven is the Brahma world.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of the Brahma world?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of the Brahma world is Mahābrahmā.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of Mahābrahmā?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of Mahābrahmā is patience and gentleness.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of patience and gentleness?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “The basis of patience and gentleness is <em>nirvāṇa</em>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>The priest again asked, “Gautama, what is the basis of <em>nirvāṇa</em>?”</p>
<p>The Bhagavān replied, “Priest, you want the basis of something that’s endless. Now, you could put limitless questions to me about it, but <em>nirvāṇa</em> has no basis. It’s only <em>nirvāṇa</em> that completely extinguishes <span class='add'>[a person]</span>. <em>Nirvāṇa</em> is the highest. Priest, the religious life is practiced under me for this goal.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>The priest again asked, “I know, Bhagavān! I understand, Sugata! Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a layman. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>This is what the Buddha said. When the priest Agrahana heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and approved.</p>
