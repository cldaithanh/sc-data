  <h1>The World</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The Tathāgata himself has discovered the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata knows the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the formation of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has ended the formation of the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the cessation of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The Tathāgata himself has discovered the way of the world and teaches it for others. The Tathāgata has cultivated the way of the world. Whatever there is that’s entirely correct, the Tathāgata has known, seen, realized, and obtained it all. Why is that?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“During the time between the night that he realized the unsurpassed, correct, and complete awakening until the day that he will choose to completely cease in the realm of remainderless <em>nirvāṇa</em>, the Tathāgata has spoken words and given responses that are all the truth. They aren’t false, don’t depart from what is, and aren’t mistaken. They’re true, they bear out, and they’re genuine. If anyone is described as a lion, they are being described like the Tathāgata. Why is that?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“The lectures that the Tathāgata gives to the assembly are called a lion’s roar. Of the whole world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā, ascetics and priests from humans to the heavens, the Tathāgata is the one who is sacred. The Tathāgata is cooled. He has no affliction and no fever. He is genuine and not false.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Thereupon, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Knowing the whole world<br>
And leaving the whole world,<br>
The Buddha explains the whole world,<br>
All the world as it really is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>He is the supreme hero sage<br>
Who has been freed from all fetters.<br>
He has brought all deeds to an end<br>
And is freed from all birth and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The gods and also the human beings<br>
Who have taken refuge in the Buddha<br>
Bow their heads down to the Tathāgata,<br>
Who is the deepest and greatest of seas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Having known him and cultivated respect,<br>
There are gods and <em>gandharva</em> spirits<br>
Who also bowed their heads to the Buddha<br>
And continue to follow him in death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Bowing their heads down before that wise man,<br>
They take refuge in the best of humans.<br>
Without sorrow or dust and at peace,<br>
Nothing obstructs their liberations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Thus, they always enjoy meditation,<br>
While living aloof and fully settled.<br>
They themselves have realized insight.<br>
Without me, they would’ve missed their chance.<br>
Those who missed it are aggrieved,<br>
When they fall down into Hell.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
