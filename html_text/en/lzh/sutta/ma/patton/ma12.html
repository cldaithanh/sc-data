<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was travelling among the Śākya people of Kapilavastu and stayed at the banyan tree park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and a group of monks had assembled in the discussion hall after the midday meal to do some task. At the time, a Jain disciple from the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa went for a walk in the afternoon. When he happened upon Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana, they exchanged greetings, and he withdrew to sit at one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Thereupon, Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana questioned that Jain about this topic: “Vāṣpa, what do you think? If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, do you think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Vāṣpa replied, “Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, I do think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife. Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if he had committed acts that aren’t good in a previous life, that would cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>At that time, the Bhagavān was sitting in a quiet place. Using his heavenly ear that goes beyond that of humans, he heard Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana and that Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa having this conversation. Having overheard them, the Bhagavān rose from his seat of repose that afternoon and went to the discussion hall. He prepared a seat in front of the assembled monks and sat down. Once he was seated, the Bhagavān asked, “Maudgalyāyana, what were you discussing with this Jain disciple of the Śākya tribe named Vāṣpa? And what was the reason for your meeting here in the discussion hall?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana said, “Bhagavān, I and this group of monks assembled here in the discussion hall today after the midday meal to do something. This Jain disciple Vāṣpa was out walking this afternoon and came upon us. We exchanged greetings, and he withdrew to sit at one side. I questioned him about this: ‘Vāṣpa, what do you think? If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, do you think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Vāṣpa answered me: ‘If a monk guards his body, speech, and mind, I do think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife. Mahāmaudgalyāyana, if he committed acts that aren’t good in a previous life, that would cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.’ Bhagavān, this was the conversation between myself and Vāṣpa. This was the reason we assembled here in the discussion hall.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>The Bhagavān then said to Vāṣpa, “If what I say is correct, you should say, ‘So it is.’ If it isn’t correct, then you should say, ‘That’s not so.’ If you have doubts about it, then you can ask me, ‘Ascetic Gautama, what’s the reason for this? What’s the meaning of that?’ If you can accept what I say, then you and I can have a discussion about this topic.”</p>
<p>Vāṣpa replied, “Ascetic Gautama, if what you say is correct, I will say, ‘So it is.’ If it’s not correct, then I will say, ‘That’s not so.’ If I have doubts, I will ask Gautama, ‘Gautama, what’s the reason for this? What’s the meaning of that?’ I will then accept and retain what ascetic Gautama says about it. The ascetic Gautama will discuss this topic only with me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The Bhagavān then asked, “Vāṣpa, what do you think? Suppose a monk creates unskillful physical actions that were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs. Some time after that, he ceases that unskillful physical action and doesn’t do any new deeds. Abandoning his former deeds, he then reaches the final end in the present life and has no affliction or fever. He always lives unchanging, which is to say what is seen and known by a noble sage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“As his body action was unskillful, his speech was unskillfully, and his mental action was unskillful. His ignorant actions were contaminants, afflictions, fevers, and griefs. Some time after that, he ceases his unskillful and ignorant actions and doesn’t do any new deeds. Abandoning his former deeds, he then reaches the final end in the present life and has no affliction or fever. He always lives unchanging, which is to say what is seen and known by a noble sage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“How is it, Vāṣpa? Do you think that a monk guarding his body, speech, and mind in this way could produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife?”</p>
<p>Vāṣpa answered, “Gautama, if a monk guards his body, speech, and mind in this way, I don’t think that could cause him to produce contaminants that aren’t good, that lead to an afterlife.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The Bhagavān commended him, “Good,Vāṣpa! How is it, Vāṣpa? Suppose a monk has ended ignorance and produced insight. Having ended ignorance and produced insight, the feelings of his last body arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last body are arising.’ The feelings of his last life arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last life are arising.’ His body breaks up and his life ends. Having reached the end of his life span, all the feelings from his present life completely subside. It should be known that he has reached the final cooling.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Vāṣpa, it’s like a tree that causes a shadow to be cast. Suppose someone comes and chops that tree down at its root with a sharp axe. Peice by peice, they gradually chop it up, chopping it into ten or a hundred peices. Then, they burn it until it’s reduced to ash. It might be blown away in the wind or dumped in a river. What do you think, Vāṣpa? That shadow had existed because of the tree. Would it cease and not arise again as a result of its cause having ended?”</p>
<p>Vāṣpa replied, “Yes, Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Vāṣpa, you should know that a monk who has ended ignorance and produced insight is likewise. Having ended ignorance and produced insight, the feelings of his last body arise, and then he knows, ‘The feelings of this last body are arising.’ The feelings of his last life arise, and then he knows ‘the feelings of this last life are arising.’ His body breaks up and his life ends. Having reached the end of his life span, all the feelings from his present life completely subside. It should be known that he has reached the final cooling.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Vāṣpa, a monk who is a correctly liberated in mind in this way gains six good abiding places. What are the six? Vāṣpa, seeing forms with his eye, a monk isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. Vāṣpa, this is called the first good abiding place gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Thus … with his ear … nose … tongue … body … knowing notions with his mind, he isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. Vāṣpa, this is called the sixth good abiding place gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Vāṣpa, these are the six good abiding places gained by a monk who is correctly liberated in mind in this way.</p>
<p>“Vāṣpa said, “Yes, Gautama. A well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way gains six good abiding places. What are the six? Gautama, seeing forms with his eye, a well-versed noble disciple isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. Gautama, this is called the first good abiding place gained by a well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. Thus … with his ear … nose … tongue … body … knows notions with his mind, he isn’t pleased or displeased. With correct mindfulness and correct understanding, he abandons pursuits and does nothing. So it is, Gautama. This is called the sixth good abiding place gained by a well-versed noble disciple who is correctly liberated in mind in this way. So it is, Gautama. A well-versed noble disciple who is liberated in mind in this way gains these six good abiding places.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>Vāṣpa then said to the Bhagavān, “I’ve comprehended it, Gautama. I’ve understood, Sugata. Gautama is like a man with clear vision who turns up what has been overturned, reveals what has been hidden, points the way to the lost, and provides a light in the dark so that those with eyes can see a form. The ascetic Gautama is like this. He has explained the Dharma and made its meaning plain to me using measureless methods, which accords with the profound awakening. Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Bhagavān, I’ve been like a man who breeds poor quality horses hoping to make a profit, but he exhausts himself and doesn’t obtain any profit. Bhagavān, I’ve been like that. Those foolish Jains don’t comprehend well, cannot understand, aren’t familiar with the excellent field, and don’t investigate things for themselves. I’ve revered, supported, and paid homage to them hoping to gain some profit from it for a long time, but it has been pointless, painful, and profitless. For the second time, Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote myself to them for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Bhagavān, I knew nothing before, believing and respecting those foolish Jains. That stops today. Why is that? Because they fooled me. For the third time, Bhagavān, I now devote myself to the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha of monks. Please, Bhagavān, accept me as a lay disciple. Starting today, I will devote to myself to them for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>This is what the Buddha said. Vāṣpa and the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
