  <h1>The Path of Calming</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Junior monks who’ve recently accomplished the precepts should frequently resort to the path of calming by contemplating these signs: signs of bones, blueness, rot, being eaten, and the skeleton. Once these signs have been well perceived and retained, they should return to their residence. They should then wash their hands and feet, spread out their sitting mat, sit down cross-legged on that seat, and recollect these signs: signs of bones, blueness, rot, being eaten, and the skeleton. Why is that? If that monk develops these signs, he will quickly rid his mind of the illnesses of desire and dislike.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Thereupon, the Bhagavān spoke these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If a junior monk’s training<br>
Has yet to yield a calm mind,<br>
He should resort to the path of calming<br>
Wanting to get rid of his lust.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>With no hateful disputes in his heart,<br>
He has compassion for sentient beings.<br>
Everywhere in all directions,<br>
He goes to contemplate their bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>He should observe the sign of blueness<br>
And being rotten, putrid, and scattered.<br>
Observe them eaten by birds and insects<br>
And their bones linked together with sinews.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Having developed these signs,<br>
<span class='add'>[Junior monks]</span> return to their homes,<br>
Wash their hands and feet,<br>
Prepare a seat, and sit upright.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>They should contemplate truly<br>
Their own body and other bodies,<br>
The feces and urine filling them,<br>
And their hearts, kidneys, livers, and lungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>If they want a serving of food,<br>
They go among people in a village.<br>
Like officers marching in armor,<br>
Their attention is on what’s ahead of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>If they see a form that’s lovely<br>
And associated with desire for purity,<br>
They observe its reality upon seeing it,<br>
Mindful of the Buddha’s Dharma and Vinaya.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>There are no bones or sinews,<br>
Neither flesh nor blood,<br>
No heart, kidneys, liver, or lungs,<br>
And no tears, spit, or brains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The whole earth is empty,<br>
And likewise is the water element.<br>
Empty is all that is fire element;<br>
Likewise is the air element empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Whatever feelings they have<br>
That are associated with the desire for purity,<br>
They are all calmed<br>
And observed the way a sage observes them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>They practice in this way diligently,<br>
Recollecting perceptions of the impure.<br>
Ending lust, hate, and delusion forever,<br>
They are rid of all ignorance.<br>
When they produce pure insight,<br>
A monk reaches the end of suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
