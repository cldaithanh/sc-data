  <h1>The Prominent Man Hastaka (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to Āṭavikā and stayed at Agrāṭavika Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “The prominent man Hastaka possesses eight unprecedented qualities. What are the eight? The prominent man Hastaka has few desires, and he is faithful, modest, conscientious, diligent, mindful, settled, and wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has few desires’? Hastaka himself has few desires, but he doesn’t want others to know, ‘I have few desires.’  … faithful … modest … conscientious … diligent … mindful … settled … wise …  Hastaka himself has wisdom, but he doesn’t want others to know, ‘I have wisdom.’ This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has few desires.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is faithful’? Hastaka has obtained a firmness of faith. He is deeply attached to the Tathāgata, has established the faculty of faith, and will never follow ascetics and priest of other religions, gods like Māra and Brahmā, or any other worldly person. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is faithful.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is modest’? Hastaka always conducts himself with modesty. He is ashamed and feels shame about bad and unskillful things, defilements, and afflictions that bring bad results and create the roots of birth and death. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is modest.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is conscientious’? He is embarrassed and feels embarrassment by bad and unskillful things, defilements, and afflictions that bring bad results and create the roots of birth and death. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is conscientious.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is diligent’? Hastaka always conducts himself with diligence. He rids himself of what’s bad and unskillful and cultivates skillful things. He constantly motivates himself, focuses firmly on the roots of goodness, and doesn’t abandon the means to do so. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is diligent.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is mindful’? Hastaka observes internal body as body, observes internal feelings … mind … principles as principles. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is mindful.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is settled’? Hastaka secludes himself from desires and bad and unskillful things … and accomplishes the fourth <em>dhyāna</em>. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is settled.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Why do I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is wise’? Hastaka cultivates wisdom. He observes the principle of arising and decline and acquires knowledge that accords with it. He masters the noble wisdom, discerns it, and comprehends it. He uses it to correctly end suffering. This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka is wise.’ This is why I say, ‘The prominent man Hastaka has eight unprecedented qualities.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>This is what the Buddha said. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
